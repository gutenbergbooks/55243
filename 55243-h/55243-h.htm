<br />A Stolen Typewriter</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something Miss Pringle can use!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy ran her fingers over the tiny, embossed <span class="sc">Reward
of Merit</span> card as if she couldn&rsquo;t bear to part
with it even for the short time it would be on exhibit
at the Roulsville library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wheatley is still Miss Pringle to you, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo; asked Peter Dobbs, smiling at his young wife
as she knelt beside the open drawer of the old chest
where her grandmother&rsquo;s keepsakes were stored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do think of her as Miss Pringle,&rdquo; confessed Judy,
&ldquo;and she probably thinks of me as that noisy Judy
Bolton. Prim Miss Pringle is what I used to call her.
She left everything in such perfect order, it&rsquo;s hard for
me to believe she and Bob Wheatley lived in our house
for two whole months. We won&rsquo;t ever rent it again,
will we, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not asking me to promise we won&rsquo;t, are
you?&rdquo; he countered. &ldquo;You know how I feel about
promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, too,&rdquo; declared Judy, reaching into
the drawer for another one of Grandmother Smeed&rsquo;s
treasured keepsakes. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a sewing card worked in
cross-stitch. It says: &lsquo;<span class="sc">Promise Little. Do Much.</span>&rsquo; Do
you think it would do for the September exhibit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; Peter replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;A
maxim like that would do for any time of the year.
Does the library plan to exhibit a few of these things
each month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but just for the school year. Miss Pringle&mdash;I
mean Mrs. Wheatley says she wants me to arrange
them in that little glass case near the library door.
These reward-of-merit cards used to be given out at
school when Grandma was a little girl. The other
card was a sewing lesson. &lsquo;Promise little. Do much,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Judy repeated, &ldquo;but how much can a person do in a
day? Maybe I won&rsquo;t try to sort all these treasures this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a good start. I wish I could stay and
help you. I always liked treasure hunting,&rdquo; Peter confessed,
&ldquo;but Uncle Sam expects me to hunt criminals
today. We&rsquo;ll be using an official car, so I&rsquo;ll leave the
Beetle for you to transport your exhibit to the library
if you do get it ready. &rsquo;Bye, Angel. See you at six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hope,&rdquo; Judy added as he bent to kiss her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s time was not his own. Working out of the
Resident FBI Agency in the Farringdon Post Office,
he might be sent anywhere in the territory. His assignment
now was to round up the Joe Mott gang. Judy
knew that much, although his work was confidential.
It was also dangerous. Each time he left the house she
breathed a little prayer for his safe return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; was what she usually said, but in her
heart the words meant, &ldquo;Take care of our future. Let
all our dreams for our married life in this house come
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house had been willed to Judy by her grandmother,
and it was so sturdy and well built that she
felt sure it would stand there on the slope overlooking
Dry Brook as long as the hills themselves.</p>
<p>Peter had left the stair door open, and soon Judy
heard Blackberry padding up to keep her company.
He looked around, the way cats will, and then came
into the storeroom to see what Judy was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Blackberry! You can&rsquo;t play with these things,&rdquo;
she told him as she continued sorting and arranging
the cards that were to be exhibited at the library. The
theme for September would be school. She found a
few Hallowe&rsquo;en things and a Columbus Day card
which she put aside for October. There were turkeys
and prayers of Thanksgiving for November, a pile of
Christmas things for December, and a stack of old
calendars for January. The stack grew higher and
higher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe Grandma saved a calendar for every
year. This is wonderful,&rdquo; Judy said to herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find some recent calendars and complete the collection.
It will be just perfect for the January exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The library was new, and the built-in exhibit cases
were still empty. Nearly all the buildings in Roulsville
were new since the flood that had swept the valley
and started Judy on the trail of her first mystery. Her
own home had been swept away, and her father, Dr.
Bolton, had been obliged to move to Farringdon
where he still lived and practiced. Only her grandmother&rsquo;s
house, two miles above the broken dam, had
stayed the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I love it,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>And yet she and Peter had made changes. It was a
rambling old farmhouse too big for just the two of
them so only the downstairs rooms had been changed.
Up here in the attic nothing had been disturbed except
by Blackberry as he played with the spools in Judy&rsquo;s
sewing room or searched for mice in the other two
rooms where her grandmother&rsquo;s keepsakes were
stored. She liked having him for company as she
worked. Attics and black cats seemed to go together.</p>
<p>Judy smiled at this thought. She was so absorbed in
what she was doing that at first she didn&rsquo;t hear the
front doorbell ringing downstairs. It rang again more
insistently, and she gathered Blackberry in her arms
and hurried down the two flights of stairs. It wouldn&rsquo;t
do to leave the cat alone among the things she had
collected for the exhibit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;even if you are a
famous cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackberry wore a life-saving medal on his collar,
and just recently he had worked for the government,
or so Judy insisted, ridding the Capitol Building of
mice. But when she opened the door he fled through it
to prowl around outside like any ordinary cat.</p>
<p>The cat startled Holly Potter, Judy&rsquo;s sixteen-year-old
neighbor, who had rung the bell. Obviously she
had been running at break-neck speed along the shortcut
from her house to Judy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took you so long? I thought you&rsquo;d never answer
the bell. Quick!&rdquo; she urged breathlessly.
&ldquo;Maybe we can still head off that green car! There&rsquo;s
a thief in it. He stole my typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your typewriter?&rdquo; gasped Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the one you gave me for my birthday. Remember
when we traded birthdays so mine wouldn&rsquo;t
come on Christmas? I loved that typewriter, and
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and get it back,&rdquo; Judy reassured her.
&ldquo;Come on, Holly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were off down the road in the Beetle before
Holly had finished telling Judy which way the green
car went. &ldquo;Try Farringdon,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;You
could see it from the top of the hill if it went toward
Farringdon, couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on how fast he was going, I
should think, but we&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; Judy promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i02.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Holly urged breathlessly." width="500" height="771" />
<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Holly urged breathlessly.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>She turned left at the main road and sped up the
long slope out of Dry Brook Hollow. At the top of
the hill the world seemed to end but, instead of driving
on into the sky the way it looked as if she might,
Judy drove down again with miles and miles of winding
road ahead of her. There wasn&rsquo;t a green car in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve lost him,&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure he went this way,&rdquo; Holly insisted. &ldquo;I
would have seen him myself if he&rsquo;d turned toward
Roulsville. You know how our road angles off in that
direction. Well, I thought if I raced along the shortcut
and we took your road maybe we could head him
off if he turned toward Farringdon. I <i>have</i> to get my
typewriter back. Can&rsquo;t you drive a little faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without turning the car over. We&rsquo;ll pick up
speed on the straight road. Then, if we can&rsquo;t find him,
we&rsquo;ll report the stolen typewriter when we get to
Farringdon. Did he take anything else?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just the typewriter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo; Judy couldn&rsquo;t quite picture a
thief running into Holly&rsquo;s house, grabbing her typewriter,
and not touching anything else. She had a rare
old paperweight and a brand-new tape recorder in
the first-floor room she called her study. Either of
these things would have been worth more than her
typewriter, to say nothing of the valuables stored in
what she had once called her forbidden chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing strange about it,&rdquo; declared
Holly. &ldquo;He would have taken more if I hadn&rsquo;t surprised
him and called Ruth. She was busy with the
baby and didn&rsquo;t pay any attention. Doris had just left
in her car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;The thief probably
saw your sister Doris leaving and figured you were all
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we weren&rsquo;t. I was there, and I saw him run
out of the house toward a green car. Please drive
faster, Judy! I have to get my typewriter back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly, like rain from a clear blue sky, Holly
burst into tears. She was crying over more important
things than a stolen typewriter, Judy knew. It wasn&rsquo;t
easy living with a married sister whose whole interest
centered on her own husband and baby. Holly&rsquo;s other
sister was on her way to a teaching job at some private
school in Maine. The girls&rsquo; uncle had died while Judy
and Peter were in Washington. Holly said she had
never felt more lost and alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First it was my parents and then Uncle David. It&rsquo;s
always this way,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I told my sisters I
wouldn&rsquo;t dare love them. It&rsquo;s bad luck for me to love
anybody. Even the <i>things</i> I love have to be taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find your typewriter,&rdquo; Judy resolved as she
drove on toward Farringdon as fast as safety allowed.</p>

<br />Help for Holly</h2>
<p>Farringdon was a much larger town than Roulsville.
Actually, it was a small city and the county seat
of a hilly county in northern Pennsylvania. The courthouse,
tall and imposing with its clock tower, stood
at the corner of Main and Grove streets. Just opposite
was the office of the <i>Farringdon Daily Herald</i> where
Judy&rsquo;s brother Horace worked as a reporter. Farther
up Grove Street was Dr. Bolton&rsquo;s combined home and
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way shall we turn?&rdquo; Judy asked when they
came to the corner.</p>
<p>Holly shook her head. &ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
Maybe my typewriter wasn&rsquo;t stolen after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; Judy was so surprised that she nearly hit
the curb as they turned the corner. &ldquo;If we aren&rsquo;t following
a typewriter thief, then what are we doing in
Farringdon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are&mdash;I mean we were following that green
car, and I think my typewriter is in it. It&rsquo;s just that I&mdash;I
mean I haven&rsquo;t told you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;Maybe
Horace would help us for the sake of the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to have his help,&rdquo; declared Holly almost
too enthusiastically. &ldquo;There he is now, walking down
Grove Street. Oh dear! Is that Honey with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It usually is,&rdquo; replied Judy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re practically
engaged, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know. Good things happen to everyone
but me,&rdquo; was Holly&rsquo;s doleful comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
probably be an old maid and live all alone without
even a cat for company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Judy hailed her brother.
He and Peter&rsquo;s sister came over to the side of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly thinks her typewriter was stolen,&rdquo; Judy explained.
&ldquo;On top of all the other trouble she&rsquo;s had, this
was just too much. Have you seen a green car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several of them,&rdquo; replied Horace. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite
common, or haven&rsquo;t you noticed? Come to think of it,
a green car did roar up Main Street about ten minutes
ago. The driver was a boy of about sixteen. Dark
hair, striped T-shirt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; Holly interrupted. &ldquo;Do you think
we can still overtake him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; replied Judy, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not making
any rash promises. Didn&rsquo;t you just tell me you&rsquo;re not
sure he is the thief? You didn&rsquo;t actually see him take
your typewriter, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I did see him running toward that green
car, and when I turned around my desk top was
empty. Ruth said maybe Doris took it. You know the
way sisters are, always borrowing things without asking.
But I don&rsquo;t believe it. Doris knows I need my
typewriter. Please drive on, Judy,&rdquo; Holly pleaded.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let that boy get away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he did get away with it,&rdquo; Horace told
her. &ldquo;If he did take your typewriter, he must be half-way
to Ulysses with it by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the town where we turned off when we
visited the Jewell sisters,&rdquo; Honey put in, &ldquo;on our secret
quest, didn&rsquo;t we, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about that. You two girls have all the fun,&rdquo;
Holly complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; Judy echoed, remembering how frightened
she and Honey had been. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s fun&mdash;&rdquo; She shivered,
and her voice trailed off into thoughts of their
latest mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were drenched to the skin and that criminal,
Joe Mott, was after us. I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s back in prison. I
can&rsquo;t understand it, though,&rdquo; Honey continued in a
puzzled voice. &ldquo;Aldin Launt, that artist who works at
the Dean Studios, was never picked up. He works
right near me, and every time he passes my desk I get
the shivers. I thought Peter was going to arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; agreed Judy, &ldquo;but maybe he&rsquo;s being
watched in the hope he will lead the FBI to the rest
of the gang. Peter&rsquo;s work is so secret that half the
time he can&rsquo;t even discuss it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t discuss it now,&rdquo; implored Holly. &ldquo;If
we&rsquo;re going to follow that green car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch him,&rdquo; Horace predicted, &ldquo;and
how would you get your typewriter back if you did?
A couple of girls couldn&rsquo;t handle a thief, especially if
he&rsquo;s got a gun on him. I don&rsquo;t suppose you can make a
federal case out of it, but couldn&rsquo;t you report it to the
local police? I&rsquo;ll call them right now if you say the
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Judy?&rdquo; Holly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it if I were you, Holly,&rdquo; she advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, then,&rdquo; Horace said with a satisfied gleam
in his eyes. &ldquo;Just give me all the details. Then we&rsquo;ll relax
and let the police handle it. Honey and I were on
our way to lunch. How about joining us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy looked up at the courthouse clock. &ldquo;Oh dear!
The morning&rsquo;s gone. I didn&rsquo;t think it was lunchtime
already. I am hungry. Aren&rsquo;t you, Holly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl insisted that she couldn&rsquo;t eat a
thing, but once they were inside the restaurant she
changed her mind. &ldquo;I guess I could eat a hamburger,&rdquo;
she conceded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>While Horace went to telephone, the three girls
ordered lunch. Holly was still jumpy. She kept tossing
her mane of thick brown hair like a restless colt. She
wore it perfectly straight in a long pony tail. Judy&rsquo;s
red curls were cut a little shorter than usual, but
Honey had let her lovely honey-colored hair grow
long to please Horace. Today she wore it loose about
her shoulders.</p>
<p>The three girls were very different in appearance,
but they had one thing in common. All three of them
adored Judy&rsquo;s brother, Horace Bolton. He was a shy-appearing
young man. To look at him, no one would
suspect that he had once startled the town of Roulsville
out of its complacency by racing through the
streets on Judy&rsquo;s ginger colt and crying out, &ldquo;The
dam is breaking! Run for the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking back, Judy realized that since Horace
had become a hero, he had changed. There wasn&rsquo;t a
note of timidity in his voice as he talked with the
police officer who later came in and quietly seated
himself at their table. It was Holly who was frightened.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d send a policeman,&rdquo;
were her first words. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure of anything.
Maybe it&rsquo;s all a big mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take that chance,&rdquo; the officer replied, smiling
as he wrote out his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, Judy,&rdquo; Horace suggested as they
were leaving the restaurant. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you and
Holly drive on a ways? Maybe you&rsquo;ll see that
green car parked somewhere along the road. I&rsquo;ll finish
up a little job I&rsquo;m doing and tell Mr. Lee this looks like
a story. He&rsquo;ll give me the afternoon off to follow it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Honey? Do you have to go back
to work?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess Mr. Dean would give me the afternoon
off if I asked him. I can&rsquo;t do any work with all
that hammering going on anyway. Where shall we
meet you?&rdquo; Honey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beaver dam!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, suddenly enthusiastic.
&ldquo;Remember, Honey? Violetta said she&rsquo;d
show it to us. I have my camera in the car. Maybe we
could take pictures of the beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date! Violetta is the younger of the two
Jewell sisters,&rdquo; Honey explained to Holly, &ldquo;though
neither of them is young. They&rsquo;re such dears! They
live in one of the oldest houses in this section of
Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s like stepping back in time just to
visit them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask them if they have anything for the library
exhibit. I have the job of choosing the displays for
those new cases in the Roulsville library,&rdquo; Judy explained.
&ldquo;All right, Horace, we&rsquo;ll see you and Honey
at the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />A Rude Shopkeeper</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the beaver dam holds better than that one
just above Roulsville,&rdquo; Holly commented as they
started off again. &ldquo;We have to pass it on the way to
school. I remember how it was last term. The boys
and girls in the school bus quiet down fast if they happen
to glance out the window and see those big pieces
of broken concrete. A lot of them lost their homes
when that dam broke, just the way you did, Judy.
Did you go back afterwards to see if anything could
be saved?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;We went back too late, I guess. We didn&rsquo;t find
much of anything. There&rsquo;s always some looting after
a big disaster like that. People are too interested in
making sure all their loved ones are safe to worry
about their possessions.&rdquo; Judy paused. She had been
younger than Holly was now when the Bolton family&rsquo;s
home in Roulsville had been swept away in the
flood, but it still hurt to think about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad had to treat a lot of people for shock,&rdquo; she
continued as they drove past the Post Office, where
Peter&rsquo;s office was, and entered the outskirts of Farringdon.
&ldquo;Our house was turned over and one
wall smashed in. I guess the furniture just floated
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to float somewhere, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Holly questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would, but we never found it.
Grandma wanted us to take some of her things,&rdquo; Judy
remembered, &ldquo;but we thought it would be better to
leave her house the way it was and buy everything
new. Of course we couldn&rsquo;t replace the beautiful
fruitwood bench Dad had in his reception room or the
lady table. That was a lovely period piece that had
been in the Bolton family for generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What period?&rdquo; asked Holly, who was something
of an expert on antique furniture. She once had lived
with a cousin who collected antique glassware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empire, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empire furniture is valuable. Usually it&rsquo;s pretty
solid, too. Why did you call it the lady table?&rdquo; Holly
wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name I gave it when I was a little girl.
There were ladies carved on the legs. They held the
marble table top on their heads. They had such quiet,
patient faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Judy was thinking back in spite of herself.</p>
<p>It had been exciting, furnishing the so-called
Haunted House in Farringdon and exposing its
&ldquo;ghosts.&rdquo; New furniture had been bought, and a few
good antiques had been discovered in out-of-the-way
shops. Dr. Bolton&rsquo;s massive oak desk was one such
piece. Judy&rsquo;s dresser with the secret drawer was
another. Buying it all by herself had been a real adventure.
Only gradually had she come to realize their
loss.</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s thoughts broke off as she suddenly stopped
the car. They had been driving through a small town
to the north of Farringdon. A dingy row of gray
houses lined the road. Some of their porches had been
sheared off in order to widen the highway, and some
had been made into shops. Judy had noticed one of
the signs:</p>
<p class="center">H. SAMMIS
<br /><span class="sc">Antiques, Used Furniture Bought and Sold</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a green car in the driveway!&rdquo; exclaimed
Holly. &ldquo;Oh, Judy! Luck is with us after all.
That boy may be inside right now trying to sell my
typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s still in the car. Let&rsquo;s have a look,&rdquo; Judy
suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>She parked the Beetle right behind the green car,
blocking the driveway. No one seemed to be around
so Judy and Holly carefully examined the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty! He&rsquo;s probably trying to sell it. Come on
inside,&rdquo; Holly urged, pulling Judy along with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry. He can&rsquo;t get out while
we&rsquo;re parked there, and I want to take down his license
number! There!&rdquo; Judy announced when she
had it. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go in like any other customers and
pretend we want to buy something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A typewriter!&rdquo; agreed Holly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just ask.
Then, if we see mine, we&rsquo;ll call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy shook her head. She didn&rsquo;t think it would be
that easy, but she was willing to go along with Holly
just for the adventure. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find your typewriter,&rdquo;
she told her, &ldquo;we may find some old cards
for my collection. Anyway, it will do no harm to go
in and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at all the lovely old glassware in the windows,&rdquo;
Holly pointed out as they walked around to
the front of the shop. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a blue glass hen just
like the one Cousin Cleo has in her collection. And
look at those chalkware lambs and that beautiful
luster cream pitcher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the shop it was hard to move around because
of all the old furniture crowded into every inch of
floor space. Judy had to move a chair to reach the
cream pitcher Holly had admired. Before she could
touch it, a voice barked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful there! You&rsquo;ll have to pay for anything you
break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of breaking anything,&rdquo; replied
Judy. &ldquo;I just wanted to see that luster cream pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s eighty dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! I guess I don&rsquo;t want it then. We really
came in to look at typewriters. You do sell typewriters,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Judy asked, looking around the shop
to see if the driver of the green car had come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New ones,&rdquo; Holly added. Her typewriter was almost
new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came to the wrong place for a new typewriter.
We sell anything and everything so long as it&rsquo;s
old.&rdquo; The shopkeeper, a stout, balding man, looked at
the two girls as if he considered them slightly stupid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant&mdash;almost new,&rdquo; Holly stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Mr. Sammis? Will you let us see what you
have, please?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>He showed them a row of ancient typewriters in
the back of the shop. They were all of the same make,
and all were equally old and dusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any others?&rdquo; Holly&rsquo;s voice held disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s all we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone of voice plainly told the girls he wished
they&rsquo;d go, but Judy wasn&rsquo;t ready to leave until she had
done a little more exploring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m collecting old cards and calendars for a library
exhibit,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Do you have anything I can
use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the box over there. But don&rsquo;t be all day looking
them over. Your car&rsquo;s parked right in front of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sammis had just seen it through the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that your car?&rdquo; Judy asked innocently. &ldquo;We
saw a boy driving it this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been parked right
where it is all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy and Holly looked at each other. They could
have made a mistake. Green cars were common, just
as Horace had said. The typewriter wasn&rsquo;t in the shop,
and neither was the boy who had been seen driving a
green car. Voices came from the upper floor, but they
were indistinct. Then, suddenly, something was
dropped with a loud thud. Holly jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; Mr. Sammis explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always
dropping things. Did you find anything you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Judy replied. She and Holly had been
looking through the box of old cards. Near the bottom
Judy found a little booklet marked <i>School Souvenir</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something for the September exhibit,&rdquo; she
said as she opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s for the close of school,&rdquo; Holly objected,
reading over her shoulder. The illuminated verse read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! Swift the time has fled away</p>
<p class="t">As fleeting as the rose</p>
<p class="t0">Since school began its opening day</p>
<p class="t">Till now its day of close.</p>
</div>
<p>The verse was followed by the name of the teacher
and pupils in some long-ago country school. Hugh
Sammis was one of the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this for sale?&rdquo; Judy asked, sure he wouldn&rsquo;t want
to part with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>He laughed, an unpleasant sort of laugh as if he were
making fun of her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s junk. I was going to throw it
out. You can have it for a quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it then,&rdquo; Judy decided. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the beginning
of school, too,&rdquo; she pointed out as she and
Holly made their way back to the front of the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful there!&rdquo; Mr. Sammis warned again.</p>
<p>It was his own elbow that knocked over the little
table with the claw feet, but he looked at Judy as if
she had done it. One foot with a claw clutching a glass
ball fell to the floor. He picked it up and waved it in
Judy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he charged unreasonably.
&ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d have to pay for anything
you broke. Young people nowadays are all alike. Careless,
blundering fools, the lot of them. Come in
here for junk and break up my best furniture! This
table is fragile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it is,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;The claw fell off
because the table leg was already broken. I can see
where it&rsquo;s been glued. The top is warped, too. It looks
as if it had been left out in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if it was? Where else could I leave it when
the roadmakers took half my house? I won&rsquo;t charge
you much for it. Only fifteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen dollars! What are you talking about, Mr.
Sammis? I&rsquo;ll never pay for a table I didn&rsquo;t break,&rdquo; Judy
declared with indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, eh? We&rsquo;ll see about that. You&rsquo;re Dr.
Bolton&rsquo;s daughter, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll just send him a bill
for twenty dollars,&rdquo; the shopkeeper announced with a
satisfied chuckle. &ldquo;Then, if he won&rsquo;t pay his bill, I
won&rsquo;t pay mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; Judy cried, her gray eyes blazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Then I&rsquo;ll make it twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go before he puts the price any higher,&rdquo;
Holly urged, pulling at Judy&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>

<br />A Mysterious Truck</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Judy, come on,&rdquo; Holly begged again as
Judy stopped to examine more of the used furniture
piled near the front of the shop. The warped and
broken table had aroused her curiosity. It seemed as if
she had seen it somewhere before, but she couldn&rsquo;t remember
where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody had furniture with claw feet like that,&rdquo;
she mused.</p>
<p>An old rocker looked familiar, too. It was in good
condition. She was tempted to ask the price and then
thought better of it. Mr. Sammis was sure to overcharge
her. Then, too, there was always the danger
that he might break something else and blame her for
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; she repeated, more to herself than to
Holly, as they left the shop.</p>
<p>A builder&rsquo;s truck bearing New York license plates
drove up just as Judy and Holly got into the Beetle.
The driver, a husky man with a tanned face and very
light blue eyes, leaned out and called to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move your car out of there!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
heavy stuff in here. Have to park as close to the shop as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way out,&rdquo; Judy told him, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll
have to back up a little to give us room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got room enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He refused to move the huge panel truck. The
name <span class="sc">John Beer</span> was lettered on the panel with the
words <span class="sc">Carpenter and Contractor</span> below it. To
Judy the truck seemed the size of a moving van. She
couldn&rsquo;t see what was in it but supposed he was hauling
building supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out that side and tell me if I&rsquo;m backing too
close,&rdquo; she directed Holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was afraid of bumping up against the shop on
the other side. One bump would be enough to spill
that whole window full of glassware. Then she <i>would</i>
have a bill! But she finally made it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cleared it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Now if anybody
knocks over the shop it will be John Beer, not us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Hugh Sammis are two of a kind. There!
He&rsquo;s opening the door of the shop. He looks angry.
Let&rsquo;s wait and see what happens,&rdquo; Holly suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;I thought you were the one who
wanted to leave&mdash;Just listen to them!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mr. Sammis was waving his arms and shouting,
&ldquo;You get out of here with that stuff! How can I buy
any more when my shop is crowded already? Take it
to some junk dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sam,&rdquo; the other protested in an equally loud
tone of voice, &ldquo;this is good furniture. I&rsquo;ve sanded and
refinished everything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t move it in here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be an old meanie,&rdquo; Holly commented,
&ldquo;but Mr. Sammis is right. He certainly doesn&rsquo;t have
room for any more furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless he has an addition built on his shop.
He could certainly use it,&rdquo; Judy said with a last glance
at the sheared-off house as they drove away.</p>
<p>Holly agreed. &ldquo;He probably makes most of his
money charging people for things they don&rsquo;t break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may make money that way, but he won&rsquo;t make
friends,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;Do you think he really intends
to send Dad a bill for twenty dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so mean he might do it. How did he know
your name, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my picture&rsquo;s been in the paper,&rdquo; Judy replied
airily. Then her face sobered. &ldquo;He must be one of
Dad&rsquo;s patients. Dad can&rsquo;t choose them, you know.
He just goes where he&rsquo;s needed and hopes the people
will pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly shook her head. &ldquo;Mr. Sammis won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="img" id="i03">
<img src="images/i03.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="800" height="597" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t owe very much. Maybe he just
came to the office.&rdquo; Judy went on exploring possibilities.
&ldquo;He could have seen my picture there. You
know how fathers are, always keeping family pictures
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Holly agreed, now more interested in the
passing scenery than in the unpleasant shopkeeper. She
noticed a little stream at the lower side of the road and
asked, &ldquo;Is that the Allegheny River?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting smaller, isn&rsquo;t
it? The head is just beyond our lot in Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lot in Gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold is the name of a town,&rdquo; Judy explained,
laughing. &ldquo;The lot was given to my father in payment
of a bill. I used to think it was a gold mine and
would make us rich some day. But doctors like Dad
never get rich. Some people can&rsquo;t pay him, and others
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she thought again of Mr.
Sammis. They drove on for a little while in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; Holly asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Judy, startled out of her thoughts, did not reply until
after they had passed the little town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Gold? I think so. If it was you
won&rsquo;t see any more houses for a while,&rdquo; Judy told her
as the car began its long climb to a lonely plateau.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on top of the world in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy! We <i>are</i> on top of the world,&rdquo; exclaimed
Holly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a marvelous view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is. Three big rivers flow in three directions
from this plateau. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the
watershed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any water,&rdquo; Holly observed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing but miles and miles of wooded hills, one after
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rivers are off there somewhere. I can&rsquo;t see
them either, but I know this is the watershed. The sky
shed water on us the last time we drove through
here,&rdquo; Judy remembered. &ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d never
make it to the Jewell place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful today.&rdquo; Holly was really enjoying the
ride. She seemed to have forgotten her disappointment
at not finding her typewriter. Now, as they crossed
the watershed, she said she was looking forward to
visiting the beaver dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Jewell sisters will go with us?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may. If they don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m sure we can find it.
They said it was down the old road that passes their
house. The bridge is out, and the road isn&rsquo;t used any
more,&rdquo; Judy added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how will we get across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a footbridge. Honey and I crossed on a
plank that floated away as soon as we were on the
other side. The river was high then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What river?&rdquo; Holly asked. &ldquo;You said the Allegheny
heads back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved her hand toward the wilderness behind
them. Ahead were more wooded hills with only now
and then a farmhouse and barn with a little cleared
land. It was a narrow road with very little traffic going
in either direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve passed the head
of the Allegheny. The other two rivers are the
Genessee and some remote branch of the Susquehanna,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Judy knew where the road to the Jewell place
turned off just beyond the next town. They were
nearly there when Holly startled her by crying out,
&ldquo;Move over, Judy! That big panel truck is trying to
pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s dangerous on this hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy could see the truck in the rear-view mirror. It
was the same one that had stopped at the used-furniture
shop. Maybe she ought to move over and let it
pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be turning off soon, anyway,&rdquo; she decided,
giving John Beer and his truck plenty of room. &ldquo;He
seems to be in a hurry, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much of a hurry,&rdquo; Holly agreed. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
have time to unload his truck or do any work. I guess
Mr. Sammis won the argument, and he&rsquo;s taking everything
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back where?&rdquo; Judy wondered as the truck sped
down the long hill and out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Another Green Car</h2>
<p>At the next crossroads Judy came to the gas station
where she and Honey had stopped to ask directions
when they first visited the Jewell sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew Honey picked up their suitcase by mistake,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked Holly. &ldquo;My, what a complicated
mystery that was! We didn&rsquo;t know exactly
what we were looking for, and so we called it a secret
quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time we know,&rdquo; Holly declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
looking for beavers, and Horace and Honey are meeting
us at the beaver dam. Maybe Peter could come,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be nice. I&rsquo;ll telephone him and leave a
message,&rdquo; Judy decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>She stopped at the gas station, telephoned the resident
agency of the FBI in the Farringdon Post Office,
and left what she thought was a clear message. After
she and Holly were on their way again she wasn&rsquo;t so
sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him we&rsquo;d be at the beaver dam. But will he
know where that is?&rdquo; Judy wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we know?&rdquo; Holly questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m depending on the Jewell
sisters to direct us. Horace knows that, but I forgot to
tell Peter. Suppose there&rsquo;s more than one beaver dam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>will</i> cause complications, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed
Holly. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s you, Judy. If you don&rsquo;t have
enough puzzles to solve, you make a few more. Peter
knows that. Anyway, a G-man should be able to find
a beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may enjoy looking for it. I know I will. If
we&rsquo;re lucky we may catch the beavers at work.
I&rsquo;m going to try and get some pictures of them. With
a flashbulb it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult. You can&rsquo;t depend
on sunlight in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be gone by the time we get there. I saw a
clock as we drove through that last town,&rdquo; Holly began.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost four&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; asked Judy, glancing at her own watch to
confirm the time. &ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t have much time to
visit. I did want to tell the Jewell sisters about the library
exhibit. Their road turns off at the top of this
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Soon they turned off the pavement. The dirt road
was in better condition than it had been when Judy
first drove along it. A week of dry, sunny weather had
helped. Ruts and mud puddles had dried up. Houses
looked more easily accessible than they had on that
other ride. There were two or three farmhouses set
far back from the road and then a long stretch of wilderness
before they came to the Jewell place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; Holly asked as soon as the big house
with its square cupola came in view. &ldquo;It looks&mdash;haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so too, when I first saw it, and so did
Honey,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe the
Jewell sisters are entertaining any ghosts today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re entertaining somebody!&rdquo; Holly exclaimed
as they came nearer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a green car parked right
in front of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re seeing green cars
everywhere today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly sounded a little hurt because Judy hadn&rsquo;t
believed her. Judy looked, blinked, and looked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m seeing green cars, too. How would it
get there?&rdquo; she asked in bewilderment. &ldquo;This road
ends at the creek. I know, because Honey and I had to
cross on a plank that tipped and nearly spilled us into
the water. The creek was high then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s gone down. The car got over there
some way,&rdquo; Holly insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Judy agreed, mystified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>She remembered the gorge with the creek at the
bottom. The banks were too steep for any car to drive
through the water. Before they came to the footbridge
that spanned the creek, Judy pointed out the place
where the Beetle had sunk into the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dry now, and the creek isn&rsquo;t half as high as it
was, but I still don&rsquo;t see how a car could get across it.
I don&rsquo;t see any tire marks, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would they show on this dry ground?&rdquo; Holly
asked when they were out of the Beetle.</p>
<p>Judy had parked the car at the end of the road. It
did end. There was no doubt of that. It ended at the
barn where the Jewell sisters kept their car. Holly
peeked in to make sure it was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t green.
You didn&rsquo;t tell me they had a car. Do they drive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Judy. &ldquo;They had a man to
drive it for them, but Dorcas said she was going to
learn. I don&rsquo;t know how they get anywhere if she
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe on broomsticks,&rdquo; Holly suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are sort of weird,&rdquo; Judy agreed, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re
quite nice old ladies, really. We&rsquo;ll ask them whose car
that is. Well, here we are. We have to cross on the
plank. You aren&rsquo;t afraid, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly laughed. &ldquo;I guess if two old ladies can make
it, I can. It does feel shaky, though,&rdquo; she admitted as
she started across the narrow footbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Judy told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right behind
you. If you slip I&rsquo;ll catch you. There! You&rsquo;re over.
That wasn&rsquo;t hard, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Holly didn&rsquo;t answer. She was staring at the house.
There were three women busy with something on the
porch. At first Judy couldn&rsquo;t see what they were doing
but, as they came nearer, she could see that they
were sorting apples. Violetta was just helping her
visitor lift a full basket into the green car when she
looked up and saw the girls approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Judy!&rdquo; she called cheerily. &ldquo;You
and Honey are just in time to sample some of our
sweet apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She called me Honey,&rdquo; Holly whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not. I&rsquo;m Holly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon discover that,&rdquo; Judy replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>Violetta was coming down the path to meet them.
&ldquo;You picked a good time to come,&rdquo; she told Judy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been out in the orchard picking apples all day.
An old friend of ours drove over here this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she get over?&rdquo; Judy asked curiously.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any bridge across the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another way&mdash;&rdquo; Violetta stopped and
looked at Holly in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not Honey. Your hair is darker. And
where&rsquo;s your cat, Judy? You promised to bring him
the next time you came to visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not a cat,&rdquo; Holly said, not meaning
to be funny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>They all laughed as the joke was repeated to the
other two women, and there were introductions all
around. Judy explained that she and Holly had come
to see the beaver dam and that they expected Horace
and Honey to meet them there. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring Blackberry
this time,&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;because when I left the
house I didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d be coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a good cat,&rdquo; Violetta said, with a
crooning sound in her voice. She had become very
fond of Judy&rsquo;s pet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep telling Violetta we should have a cat of our
own,&rdquo; Dorcas put in. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agree, Meta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I agree with what?&rdquo; the third woman asked
in a faraway voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I wasn&rsquo;t listening. I was
thinking of the Beetle and wondering if I would have
any trouble driving it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back where?&rdquo; Holly asked.</p>
<p>Judy said nothing. By now she was completely bewildered.
Was the stranger talking about the green car
or her own?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />The Woods Road</h2>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s unasked question was soon answered. The
owner of the green car proved to be the matron of a
nearby orphanage. She had been introduced as Miss
Hanley, but Judy was soon calling her Meta just as the
Jewell sisters did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the woods road,&rdquo; she said, smiling at the
girls. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been used for several years but, with
the weather so dry, I felt sure I could make it. I had to
stop the car a couple of times to remove trees the
beavers had gnawed down, but the Beetle finally
plowed through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Beetle?&rdquo; Judy questioned, still a little bewildered.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we call our car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Miss Hanley laughed. She looked younger and
prettier when she was laughing and talking. Holly
probably would call her middle-aged. Holly considered
anybody over thirty middle-aged. Judy
guessed Meta Hanley was about thirty-five. She said
she had noticed Judy&rsquo;s car as it came down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s black, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I guess that makes
two Beetles, a black one and a green one. Danny
named mine. He has names for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny, she told them, was one of the many orphans
she mothered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll love these apples,&rdquo; she told the Jewell sisters.
&ldquo;We have a few apple trees, but the apples
aren&rsquo;t ripe yet. The older children help on the farm,&rdquo;
she explained to Judy and Holly. &ldquo;We raise nearly
everything we eat. You should see the family I have
at table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could see them,&rdquo; Judy told her. &ldquo;Are
visitors allowed at the orphanage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. The children love visitors. They do react
differently to them,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Those who
want to be adopted put on their best manners. The
others run and hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they all want to
be adopted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meta is so good to them,&rdquo; Violetta put in, &ldquo;that
quite a few of them hope to stay where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, of course,&rdquo; Dorcas added. &ldquo;The orphanage
is too crowded. If Violetta and I were
younger we might consider adopting one of them ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could help,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can. We&rsquo;ve been helping,&rdquo; Violetta
told her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been giving Meta a day off now and
then. We go to church now that Dorcas is driving,
and the women in our church take turns at the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of them,&rdquo; Meta Hanley said.
&ldquo;Mrs. Alberts is there today. I must be getting back to
relieve her. Would you girls like to ride along with me
as far as the beaver dam?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It is a lonely
road, and it does bring back memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cherish them,&rdquo; Dorcas advised in her abrupt
way. &ldquo;Some day memories will be all you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did Dorcas mean? The remark hurt, Judy
could see that. Meta was silent for a moment. Then
she said, &ldquo;Well, I better be going. Perhaps you girls
would rather walk, though it&rsquo;s quite a hike to the
beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; Judy decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>is</i> the road?&rdquo; Holly asked.</p>
<p>A faint path was pointed out. It crossed the open
field, and then came a small break in the trees where it
entered the woods. The beaver dam was about a mile
farther along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop you off there, but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have
to walk back. Walking is good for the constitution,&rdquo;
the matron declared. &ldquo;I often take the orphans on
hikes. They know the country around here as well as I
do. Take Danny, for instance. He&rsquo;s only ten, but he
can tell you more about the beavers than I can. He
comes down to the pond and sits for hours just watching
them. The late afternoon is the best time to see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy glanced at her watch. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> late afternoon,
much later than I thought. I hoped Horace or Honey
or even Peter would be here by now. But if anyone
stops and asks, you&rsquo;ll direct them to the woods road,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked the Jewell sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will. Stop in and have a bite of supper
with us on your way back,&rdquo; Dorcas invited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that would be
an imposition. We&rsquo;ll stop next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; Holly promised. &ldquo;Judy has been
asked to get together a few things for an exhibit at the
library. You may have some old cards or calendars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have plenty of things. Violetta and I were
wondering what to do with them. Would you like old
Christmas cards, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall have them,&rdquo; both sisters assured
her in almost the same breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re perfect dears, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Holly asked
a little later as she and Judy and the matron of the
orphanage were bumping along on the woods road in
the green Beetle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not perfect. Dorcas is a little too abrupt and
Violetta a little too timid. I don&rsquo;t want to be like
them,&rdquo; declared Meta. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to grow old with
nothing but memories to cherish. They aren&rsquo;t enough.
Of course,&rdquo; she added after her car had bumped over
a rough place where a tree had fallen, &ldquo;the Jewell sisters
have each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have anyone?&rdquo; asked Judy with quick
sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the orphans. I&rsquo;m an orphan myself,&rdquo; she
confided, &ldquo;so I guess I really feel for them. Once I
thought I would marry and have a family of my own.
We were going to live in a big house on the other side
of the hill. This road takes me right past it.&rdquo; She
sighed. &ldquo;The windows are boarded up now, and the
yard is overgrown with weeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we pass it?&rdquo; asked Holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond the beaver dam.
This road joins another road that crosses the state line
into New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the road we took in our Beetle, is it?&rdquo;
questioned Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it crosses that, too. The orphanage is down in
the valley near the crossroads. I hope you do visit us
some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Judy and Holly promised.</p>
<p>The green car hurtled over more bumps in the little-used
road and then stopped. They must be near the
beaver dam. To their left, down a slope thick with
ferns, Judy could hear water running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are.&rdquo; Meta opened the door on her
side of the car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk a little way with you,&rdquo; she
offered. &ldquo;Otherwise you may lose time looking for
the pond. It&rsquo;s near the head of this stream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does the stream have a name?&rdquo; Judy asked as she
and Holly stepped out on the needle-covered ground.
Overhead were dark fir trees that made the woods
seem lonely and full of whispers as the wind moaned
through their branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George always called it Jewell creek,&rdquo; Meta
Hanley said. &ldquo;He used to meet me here and we&rsquo;d talk
and plan what we&rsquo;d do with the house after we were
married. Then, on the day he&rsquo;d promised to give me
my ring, he never came. Jewell creek,&rdquo; she repeated,
looking at her ringless finger. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t its real name,
of course, but the water sparkles like jewels, and it
does run past the Jewell place. Actually it&rsquo;s one of
the forks of the Genessee. The Cowanesque heads the
other side of this hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy took Holly&rsquo;s arm, her camera in her free hand.
They were near the beaver dam, so near that Judy
could see a mass of piled-up saplings cemented together
with mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pond&rsquo;s just beyond that obstruction. I&rsquo;ll leave
you here. Wait quietly on the bank. Keep yourselves
hidden in the ferns, and don&rsquo;t make a sound,&rdquo; Meta
directed the two girls, &ldquo;and you may catch a glimpse
of the beavers swimming in their pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Judy, on sudden impulse, had caught a glimpse
of something else and snapped a picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />At the Beaver Dam</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; Holly asked, puzzled.
&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there was, but maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
Judy admitted. &ldquo;I do things on impulse. Afterwards
I wonder myself why I do them. Did it seem to you
that Meta Hanley left us rather abruptly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; Holly acknowledged. &ldquo;Maybe telling
us that sad story made her feel bad. It just proves
what I said before. It&rsquo;s bad luck to love anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For her or for you?&rdquo; Judy questioned, hoping to
disprove her theory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>anybody</i>. If you haven&rsquo;t found it out yet, you
will,&rdquo; Holly prophesied, clinging grimly to her
gloomy philosophy. &ldquo;She had an appointment, but nobody
came. It makes me wonder if Horace and
Honey will keep their appointment here at the beaver
dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. Of course they will. Horace intends
to convince his editor that the beavers will make a
good story. Peter may come, too, if he gets the message
I left for him. I hope he does,&rdquo; declared Judy.
&ldquo;There are so many things I want to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of things?&rdquo; questioned Holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about rivers and stuff,&rdquo; Judy replied airily,
still not sure enough of what she had seen to report it.
&ldquo;Things could drift down with the current, you
know. I mean, if the Cowanesque heads the other side
of this hill it must flow past several houses including
that one the matron of the orphanage was talking
about. Probably it&rsquo;s one of the forks of the Susquehanna,
and I think this creek must be another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she said it was near the head of the Genessee,&rdquo;
Holly objected. &ldquo;And you told me yourself that we
could see three great river valleys from that watershed
we crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beautiful!&rdquo; Judy remembered. &ldquo;We could
see hills and valleys for miles and miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like open places like that,&rdquo; declared Holly. &ldquo;Here
in the woods you get the feeling that someone is hiding
and watching you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beavers, no doubt. We&rsquo;re the ones who should be
hiding and watching them,&rdquo; Judy reminded her. &ldquo;We
shouldn&rsquo;t be talking, either. We were told not to make
a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Holly agreed, lowering her voice
to a whisper.</p>
<p>Not another word was said as they broke their way
through the underbrush until they came to a fairly
large tree that had been gnawed down by the beavers.
The stump was right at the edge of the pond. Judy ran
her hand over it to make sure it was flat enough for
her camera. It surprised her to discover what experts
the beavers were. Their dam was solidly constructed
of mud, brushwood, and poles. But there were other
things in it, too. Things that puzzled Judy more and
more as she and Holly watched and waited. There
was no sound of falling trees as the beavers worked.
Holly asked why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beavers are smart,&rdquo; Judy whispered back. &ldquo;They
only work at night. We&rsquo;ll have to wait here until after
dark if we want to see them working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to?&rdquo; Holly asked, shivering a little at
the thought of being in the woods after dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right,&rdquo; Judy comforted her. &ldquo;Horace
and Honey will be here by then. I can get sharper
pictures with my flashbulb after dark. There will be
no other light to interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But going back in the dark will be terrible. We&rsquo;ll
get lost,&rdquo; Holly interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy reassured her. &ldquo;I have my
flashlight here in my shoulder bag.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The shoulder bag was no longer on her shoulder. It
was propped behind the stump. In it Judy had stored
a number of useful things including the sweet apples
the Jewell sisters had given them. Holly decided to eat
her apple right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; she declared, taking a big bite.</p>
<p>Judy was surprised that the sound of anyone eating
an apple could be so loud. When Holly had finished it
she tossed the apple core in the pond. It hit the surface
of the water with a loud plop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I hope I didn&rsquo;t scare the beavers,&rdquo; Holly
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! We weren&rsquo;t going to talk,&rdquo; Judy reminded her.</p>
<p>After that there was utter silence broken only by an
occasional bird twittering and the sighing of the wind
in the trees. Now and then a small <i>plop</i> could be
heard as something disappeared in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything, do you?&rdquo; Holly whispered
after what seemed an eternity of crouching among the
ferns and waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just ripples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy suspected that the beavers, swimming under
water, made the ripples that kept appearing and disappearing
on the surface of the pond. They looked
exactly like the ripples that had appeared when Holly
threw in the apple core. But nothing had fallen in so it
must be something coming up from underneath the
water. Judy had her camera ready, hoping one of the
beavers would pop out and pose for a picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there are any beavers in there,&rdquo;
Holly said at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Judy was beginning to agree with her. It was growing
so dark she could no longer see the ripples, but she
could still hear the <i>plops</i>. Once she thought she saw a
beaver&rsquo;s head and snapped a picture, but she couldn&rsquo;t
be sure she had photographed anything except an
empty pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Holly urged when it was quite dark.
&ldquo;Peter didn&rsquo;t get your message, and I told you Horace
and Honey wouldn&rsquo;t keep their appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me a lot of things,&rdquo; Judy retorted. &ldquo;I
changed my plans for the whole day because of what
you told me, but I&rsquo;m still hoping to prove you&rsquo;re
wrong about some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean about love? I hope you do.&rdquo; Holly
shivered suddenly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These
ferns are positively creepy. Snakes may be hiding in
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very likely,&rdquo; Judy told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; Holly insisted. &ldquo;Did you
hear that twig snap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see
what it was, but I snapped a picture. It sounded near
the pond. There it is again, farther back in the woods.
It could be Horace and Honey coming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy turned on her flashlight in order to see the face
of her watch. &ldquo;It is late, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Maybe
they aren&rsquo;t coming after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Now she was worried. Horace didn&rsquo;t make appointments
and break them. He was a fast driver, but not a
reckless one. Just as she was imagining her brother&rsquo;s
coffee-colored convertible in an accident a light appeared,
flooding the dark woods with the sudden brilliance
of a searchlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a car!&rdquo; Holly exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming along the
woods road. Horace didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly, <i>look</i>!&rdquo; Judy interrupted.</p>
<p>The light, moving nearer, had picked up a strange
sight. There by the pond were three beavers startled
into immobility. One of them was perched atop a
mound of sticks, grass, and moss that protruded into
the water. The other two were on the ground. One
was digging with his little front paws, and the other
was dragging something toward the dam. Judy
reached for her camera, but before she could snap
them the beavers were gone, leaving nothing but
widening ripples in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw them!&rdquo; Holly cried excitedly, jumping up
from the ferns and hugging Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you made
me wait. We saw the beavers, and that&rsquo;s Horace and
Honey in the car. Now he can take us home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Holly!&rdquo; The light from the oncoming car
had picked out something else. The piece of wood the
beaver had dropped didn&rsquo;t look like a pole. It looked
more like a chair rung. And in the dam, worked in
among the brush and the mud, was the most unbelievable
thing of all. Judy stood transfixed, staring at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Holly. &ldquo;Why are you staring at
the beaver dam? You look as if you had seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a ghost,&rdquo; declared Judy, &ldquo;or about the nearest
thing to it. That&rsquo;s our table leg. I&rsquo;d know it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your table leg?&rdquo; Holly repeated, not understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you about it,&rdquo; Judy reminded her as the light
revealed the patient face she remembered so well, just
below the surface of the water. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a leg of the lady
table. It was washed away in the Roulsville flood, and
the beavers found it and used it to build their dam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />An Impossible Discovery</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Horace! Honey! Come over here. I want to show
you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were out of the car now, coming as fast as
they could in answer to Judy&rsquo;s call. When they were
near enough to be heard, Horace asked, &ldquo;Did you see
the beavers?&rdquo; and Honey answered excitedly, &ldquo;Yes!
We saw them just as plain as plain. Their funny,
humped backs and broad, flat tails&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see what they were carrying?&rdquo; Judy interrupted.</p>
<p>Honey looked at Horace. &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stick, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Judy answered. &ldquo;I think it was a
chair rung. And Horace, I saw something else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a face in the pond,&rdquo; Holly put in. &ldquo;A lady&rsquo;s
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rdquo; Judy told her,
&ldquo;but it was every bit as uncanny. I could hardly believe
it myself. Horace, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to show him what she had discovered in
the beaver dam, but the headlights of the car were no
longer shining on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; gasped Holly. &ldquo;Judy, it <i>was</i> a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was there. I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Judy declared.
&ldquo;It was the leg of that lady table Dad used to have in
his reception room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Roulsville?&rdquo; Horace questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, before the flood. I think it must have washed
down here some way. The beavers do use pieces of
furniture in their dam building. I thought so when I
first saw it, and now I&rsquo;m sure of it. Horace, that <i>was</i>
the lady table,&rdquo; Judy insisted. &ldquo;That face I remember
so well was looking right at me. It was weird and a
little bit frightening, but I&rsquo;m sure of what I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; declared Horace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most impossible
thing I ever heard of. Furniture couldn&rsquo;t wash
<i>upstream</i> all the way from Roulsville. This is a different
stream, anyway. I believe it flows into the Genessee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meta Hanley said it did,&rdquo; Holly put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Meta Hanley?&rdquo; asked Honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matron of an orphanage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;The one where we stopped,&rdquo; Horace interrupted.
&ldquo;We missed the turn and stopped there for directions.
A woman was just driving up in a green car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t have your typewriter, Holly,&rdquo; Honey
added. &ldquo;She had her car loaded with apples for the
orphans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Miss Hanley all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She calls her car the Beetle, too. Did she tell you
she&rsquo;d brought us here?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she directed us to the woods road. She said
it would be quicker and that it would save you that
long walk through the woods after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Horace, what about our Beetle?&rdquo; Judy wanted
to know. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to leave it parked where it is all
night if we go back with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s brother asked. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
the first time. You&rsquo;ll be coming back here to investigate
what you saw and, unless I miss my guess, you&rsquo;ll
find you&rsquo;re all wrong about any of our furniture from
Roulsville being built into that beaver dam. We gave it
up as lost six years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you and Dad and Mother did, but I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Judy retorted. &ldquo;I never give up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, she&rsquo;s right there,&rdquo; Horace interrupted with a
meaning look in Honey&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;You and I both
know it. Once Judy latches onto a mystery she never
gives up until she has all the answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Judy,&rdquo; begged Holly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to find all
the answers tonight. If that was your lady table it
will still be there in the morning. It won&rsquo;t look so
spooky by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will to me,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget
that face in the pond. Couldn&rsquo;t you turn your car so
the light will shine on it again, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he replied stubbornly. &ldquo;The car&rsquo;s turned
in the direction of home, and that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re heading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Holly said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of hiding in
those creepy ferns and watching beavers. Besides, I&rsquo;m
starved. Judy and I haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat since
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a couple of apples,&rdquo; Judy reminded her.
&ldquo;The Jewell sisters gave them to us. They gave Miss
Hanley all those apples she had in her car, and they&rsquo;ve
been taking turns helping out at the orphanage,&rdquo; she
told Horace. &ldquo;Did you and Honey see any of the
orphans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just their faces looking out the orphanage windows,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;but we were asked to keep
watch for one of them, a boy about ten who likes to
visit the beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Danny,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;Miss Hanley told us
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; declared Horace. &ldquo;That lady
who was minding the children said he&rsquo;d been missing
since early morning. She seemed quite worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can watch for him on the way home, can&rsquo;t we?
Come on, Judy,&rdquo; urged Holly. &ldquo;You can come back
here tomorrow and find your lady or whatever that
was in the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Honey shivered. &ldquo;I agree with Holly. Let&rsquo;s go,
Horace. It&rsquo;s too dark to look for anything tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be back here first thing
in the morning. What about you, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you. I wish Peter could come, too. Did
you hear from him at all?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>Horace said he hadn&rsquo;t heard but he felt sure Peter
had received Judy&rsquo;s message. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably out tailing
suspects,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He is assigned to help round
up the Joe Mott gang, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t discuss his assignments,&rdquo; Judy answered.
Her brother was altogether too curious. He
knew Peter&rsquo;s work was confidential. She could understand
Horace&rsquo;s interest, though. His face was no
longer swollen from the beating he had received from
the Joe Mott gang, but there was still a small scar over
his eyebrow. He had interrupted a robbery and probably
was lucky that Joe Mott&rsquo;s boys had given him no
more than a beating. Joe was in prison, but some unknown
gang leader apparently was taking his place.
Peter had promised Horace the story as soon as it
broke, but the investigation had to be conducted in
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming, Judy?&rdquo; Holly asked when Judy
still stood there beside the stump where she had placed
her camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we might wait just a little longer for
Peter,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t know about the
woods road. He&rsquo;ll be walking over from the Jewell
place and he&rsquo;ll have his searchlight with him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; Horace interrupted. &ldquo;You intend to ask
Peter to help you investigate this impossible discovery
of yours. If the beavers have stolen furniture and
transported it across state lines he might make a federal
case out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke, Horace,&rdquo; Judy scolded him. But she
couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>All the way home Horace, Honey, and even Holly
treated her discovery as a joke. Peter wouldn&rsquo;t. She
knew that. She could tell him not only what she had
seen, but how she felt. That was one of the wonderful
things about Peter. When Judy talked, he really listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to stop for something to eat?&rdquo; Holly
asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamburgers in Farringdon,&rdquo; Judy suggested, &ldquo;but
let&rsquo;s make it fast. I want to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask you over to the apartment&mdash;&rdquo;
Honey began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other time. Your grandparents will be sleeping.
It&rsquo;s so late even the hamburger places will be
closed if we don&rsquo;t hurry,&rdquo; Horace told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It is late,&rdquo; Judy agreed a few minutes
later as Horace drove into Farringdon. She could see
the illuminated face of the courthouse clock. The
hands pointed to eleven. An hour more and it would
be midnight. Surely Peter would be waiting for her
at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I ought to call the Jewell sisters,&rdquo; Judy
suggested when they were in the restaurant in Farringdon,
having their late snack. &ldquo;I could telephone
from here and find out if Peter came by there. I did
tell him to meet us at the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find us there so late,&rdquo; Horace
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the Jewell sisters have a telephone?&rdquo; Honey
asked. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have one when we were there before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a lot of changes, but I guess it would
disturb them if we called them so late. They&rsquo;d be
sleeping, and the phone would scare them half out of
their wits, that is,&rdquo; Judy amended, &ldquo;if they do have a
phone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to ride along with me to Dry Brook Hollow?&rdquo;
Horace asked Honey as they were leaving the
restaurant.</p>
<p>Honey shook her head. &ldquo;Not tonight, Horace. Take
me home, please. I have to be at work tomorrow, remember?
And those designs I&rsquo;m doing take concentration.
I can&rsquo;t let myself fall asleep over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly watched as Horace gave Honey a quick
good-night kiss at the door of the apartment building
where she lived with her grandparents. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move
into the front seat,&rdquo; she suggested to Judy. A little
later, cuddled in between Judy and Horace, she almost
purred with contentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another complication,&rdquo; thought Judy. &ldquo;Holly
thinks she&rsquo;s in love with Horace when he and Honey
are practically engaged.&rdquo; Aloud she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad
Honey didn&rsquo;t come with us. You&rsquo;ll be driving back
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Horace agreed cheerfully, &ldquo;I
like my own company, especially when I have a lot
to think about. I may have made a joke of it, Sis, but
I&rsquo;m just as puzzled as you are. If that is your lady back
there in the pond, how did the beavers get hold of her,
and where is the rest of the table?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />More Puzzles</h2>
<p>Judy was trying to think of an answer to her brother&rsquo;s
question when she noticed the headlights of another
car just over the hilltop. It was the last hill before
they came down into Dry Brook Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Beetle!&rdquo; she exclaimed as it slowed down
and came to a standstill close by Horace&rsquo;s car. Judy
was surprised to see Blackberry in his usual place next
to the back window. Peter was driving.</p>
<p>Judy was out of Horace&rsquo;s car in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, Peter! Were you looking for me?&rdquo; she
asked, running toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; declared Peter, &ldquo;is the understatement of
the year. I practically searched the whole woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we didn&rsquo;t wait. Were you all alone?&rdquo;
Judy asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;There were two of us
in the official car, but the other agent left as soon as I
spotted the Beetle. He didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have any
trouble finding you, but he was wrong. I was about to
wake the Jewell sisters and question them when I discovered
that woods road and decided we&rsquo;d missed each
other and Horace had driven you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you drove all the way back only to find nobody
there,&rdquo; Judy anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody but a hungry cat. Red had been there, as
usual, to take care of the barn chores, but he forgot
Blackberry. He jumped in the car and went along to
help me hunt,&rdquo; Peter continued. &ldquo;We were on our way
back to the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you there before? Did you see the beavers?&rdquo;
Holly questioned from Horace&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Peter said he hadn&rsquo;t been looking for beavers. He
was looking for Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Holly home,&rdquo; Horace volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see you tomorrow, Sis, unless you&rsquo;ve changed your
mind about going back to visit your lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. Want to come with us, Holly?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I promised Ruth
I&rsquo;d baby sit while she does some shopping in Roulsville.
She&rsquo;ll take your films if you want her to. There&rsquo;s
a place right next to the library where you get fast
service. I&rsquo;ll look for old calendars and cards among
Uncle David&rsquo;s things if you want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I&rsquo;d be glad to have anything you can find.
Day after tomorrow you can help me arrange the
exhibit. Will the films be ready by then?&rdquo; Judy wondered.</p>
<p>Holly felt sure they would. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear
what you and Horace find out about that lady. Maybe
she won&rsquo;t look so spooky in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely she won&rsquo;t be there at all,&rdquo; Horace said
as they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was all this about a spooky lady?&rdquo; Peter
asked curiously, as he turned the Beetle around.</p>
<p>Judy told him. It sounded still more unbelievable in
the telling. As soon as they reached the house Peter
brought out a map to show her how impossible it was
for any of the furniture that had been washed away
in the Roulsville flood to be carried anywhere near the
beaver dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how these rivers flow. Dry Brook empties
into Roulsville Run, really the first fork of the Sinnamehoning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Sinnamehoning has a lot of forks,&rdquo; Judy
protested, studying the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Peter admitted, &ldquo;but none of them are anywhere
near the beaver dam. Anything washed down
by the flood would have ended up south of Roulsville,
not away to the north. Are you quite sure of what
you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looked like the leg of our lady table,&rdquo;
declared Judy, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t be really sure until I see it
by daylight. Horace wouldn&rsquo;t believe me, either, but
he did agree to go back there with me tomorrow. I
wish you could come with us, Peter. There&rsquo;s an orphanage
just over the hill, and if that boy is still missing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boy?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me anything
about a missing boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Danny. That&rsquo;s all I know. We were
asked to watch for him on our way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check and see if he returned. Unofficially, of
course. I&rsquo;ll be in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>
<p>Peter advised her to wait until another day when he
could go with her, but she promised to be careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t fall in the pond, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re afraid
of,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just walk out there on the
beaver dam and make sure of what I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally Peter was persuaded. In the morning he
drove Judy to Farringdon. She was in the Post Office
looking at the faces of the men wanted by the FBI
when Horace walked in and greeted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d find you here,&rdquo; he remarked dryly.
&ldquo;See anyone you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Judy replied with a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Peter&rsquo;s job to hunt for these men, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would like to help him find them,
wouldn&rsquo;t you, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends.&rdquo; Judy studied the row of faces
for a moment, memorizing every feature. Then she
pointed to one of three who were wanted for flight to
avoid prosecution. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look like a criminal,
does he?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of them do,&rdquo; declared Horace. &ldquo;They make
it their business not to look like criminals. They don&rsquo;t
want to be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be.&rdquo; Judy had boundless faith in Peter
and his associates. &ldquo;The FBI will find them. Look at
that artist who works with Honey. He doesn&rsquo;t know it,
but he&rsquo;s being watched every minute in the hope that
he will try and communicate with others of his gang
who are still at large. He will, too. Peter says there&rsquo;s a
pattern of behavior most criminals follow. He wasn&rsquo;t
sure we ought to go back to the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth not?&rdquo; Horace asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says it may be dangerous. That furniture
wasn&rsquo;t carried all the way from Roulsville by beavers,&rdquo;
declared Judy. &ldquo;There was some looting after the
flood, and I think that&rsquo;s how the lady table came to be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Horace said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but Peter wants
you to check with him before you print anything. I
may have some pictures for you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Horace answered. &ldquo;You were too late
to snap those beavers we saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had my camera focused on the pond, and I
did snap quite a few pictures in the dark. Holly is
taking the film to Roulsville today. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll
see what kind of pictures I took,&rdquo; Judy promised as
she followed her brother out to the street where his
coffee-colored convertible was waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>A ride in Horace&rsquo;s car was always exciting. He had
the top down so that they seemed to be racing the
wind. In almost no time they were passing the sheared-off
house where Mr. Sammis bought and sold antiques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the furniture in his shop had been left out
in the rain,&rdquo; Judy remembered. &ldquo;Anyway, he claimed
it had, but I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder. He had a green
car in his driveway, but he said it had been parked
there all day and, Horace, he accused me of breaking
a table that he knocked over himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant sort, wasn&rsquo;t he? Naturally, you didn&rsquo;t find
Holly&rsquo;s typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but that doesn&rsquo;t prove it wasn&rsquo;t hidden away
somewhere. The shop was so crowded he wouldn&rsquo;t accept
anything more. We left him quarreling with a
man named John Beer. Anyway, that was the name
lettered on his truck,&rdquo; Judy finished.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to rivers as they crossed
the watershed. Judy was convinced, by now, that the
lady table couldn&rsquo;t have been carried this far north by
the flood. She shivered when she thought of that patient
face in the water. Would it still be there, or had
she only imagined she saw a face?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; Horace announced.</p>
<p>Judy had been so absorbed in her own thoughts that
she hadn&rsquo;t noticed the orphanage as they passed it.
They had come to the end of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking about her in surprise.
There was the house with the boarded-up windows,
just as Meta Hanley had described it.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Horace fell headlong into the pond!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;These trees sort of block our way,&rdquo; Horace remarked
as the car squeezed through a narrow space
between two evergreens that rained prickly needles.
More trees were missed by inches. They reached the
beaver dam in a surprisingly short time. Judy was out
of the car first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she called over her shoulder.
&ldquo;Right here is where we saw the beavers last night,
and there!&rdquo; She pointed, and Horace whistled in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew-ee!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s there all right, and
she is the same lady. That beaver dam looks solid. I
think, if we go out there together, we can pull her out
of the water. You hold me, and I&rsquo;ll pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Peter I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Judy started to
object. But Horace was already walking out on the
beaver dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it, Sis. We can&rsquo;t leave the poor
damsel in distress. Just hold me so I won&rsquo;t fall in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no stopping him, Judy thought, but he
could wait until she had brushed the needles out of her
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy turned her head in surprise. She hadn&rsquo;t spoken.
At first she couldn&rsquo;t tell where the voice came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch that lady!&rdquo; the voice warned again.</p>
<p>It sounded as if the trees themselves were warning
Horace. He was so startled that he lost his balance and
fell headlong into the pond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />&ldquo;My Name Is Danny&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Horace! Horace! What happened?&rdquo; cried Judy as
her brother&rsquo;s head appeared above the surface of the
water. &ldquo;Who was that talking? Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you call being half drowned in a muddy pond all
right, I guess I am,&rdquo; he replied, answering her last
question first. The others weren&rsquo;t so easy to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she faltered, not knowing what else
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be,&rdquo; he spluttered. &ldquo;When did you
learn how to throw your voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. That wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it then?&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It sounded like a small boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wood sprite, no doubt. Don&rsquo;t think up any
more fairy stories. Just get me the car blanket before
I catch my death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Judy burst out laughing. She couldn&rsquo;t help it. When
Horace was out on the bank draped in the car blanket
he looked even funnier. But someone else was laughing,
too! Judy whirled around just as a small figure let
himself down from one of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed, grabbing the &ldquo;wood sprite&rdquo;
by the arm before he could elude her again. &ldquo;It was
you who called to my brother and made him fall. Who
are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Danny,&rdquo; he replied in the same voice
that had startled them from the tree.</p>
<p>Judy and Horace looked at each other as much as
to say, &ldquo;We might have known it.&rdquo; What they really
said was, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching the beavers,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I always watch
the beavers. I had to stop you from taking that lady
stick. You&rsquo;d bust up the whole dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lady stick,&rdquo; Horace said sternly, &ldquo;is a leg off
our table. I&rsquo;d like to know where the beavers got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dragged it here. They drag lots of stuff here
and build their dam real solid. I&rsquo;m not going to let
anyone bust it up,&rdquo; declared Danny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you, a watchman for the beavers?&rdquo;
asked Judy. &ldquo;The people at the orphanage were
worried about you. Have you been watching the
beavers all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; he replied, hanging his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>His face was so dirty Judy could hardly tell what
sort of complexion he had, but his eyes were blue.
His hair, like her own, was full of the prickly stuff the
evergreens shed. She looked from him to Horace
wrapped in his blanket and trying to sound fierce as
he scolded the boy. He kept his eyes to the ground
most of the time, not answering Horace&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Judy told her brother. &ldquo;We may as
well take him home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the boy protested, &ldquo;not to the orphanage.
Home&rsquo;s over there.&rdquo; He waved a grubby hand in the
direction of the boarded-up house. &ldquo;We used to live
there when my mother was alive, and my father said
we&rsquo;d go back and live there again. He p-promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; Judy asked gently. She
had supposed both the boy&rsquo;s parents were dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d-don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Danny gulped. &ldquo;He went away
and left me at the orphanage, but he said he&rsquo;d come
back. He promised me he&rsquo;d come back before the summer
was over so I have to be at the house waiting for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it all wrong,&rdquo; Horace told him. &ldquo;You
have to be at the orphanage waiting for him because
that&rsquo;s where he left you, and that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re taking
you right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny gave in at last. He was willing to ride back
to the orphanage with Judy and Horace if they would
promise not to touch the lady in the beaver dam.
Horace hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well promise. Danny is right,&rdquo; declared
Judy. &ldquo;It might break up the dam if we removed it,
and what good is the table leg, anyway, without the
table?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>At the orphans&rsquo; home, a square brick building that
looked more like an institution than a home, Horace
waited in the car while Judy went in with Danny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found him at the beaver dam. He was there all
night,&rdquo; she explained to the worried matron. &ldquo;He said
he had to watch the beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were there looking for him,&rdquo; Meta Hanley
protested. &ldquo;I called the police, and they searched all
around with flashlights. I can&rsquo;t understand it, but thank
you, anyway. You don&rsquo;t know how you worried us,&rdquo;
she added, turning to Danny. &ldquo;I called the FBI this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t kidnapped,&rdquo; the boy protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be sure. I didn&rsquo;t know what to think. I
know you like to watch the beavers, but you never
did anything like this before. I still can&rsquo;t understand
why you stayed out all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to,&rdquo; Danny insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I can&rsquo;t tell you. I hope&mdash;the FBI, they&rsquo;ll
ask a lot of questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t want to answer them? Is that it,
Danny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matron&rsquo;s voice was gentle. Her love for this
boy, no matter what he did, was apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell them everything is all right now. Just leave
it to me,&rdquo; Judy began. &ldquo;If I see their car on the way
here I&rsquo;ll stop it and tell them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you <i>know</i> an FBI car?&rdquo; the matron asked
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Judy smiled. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t say that her husband might be one of the
agents in it. Usually they worked in pairs and rode in
an official car equipped with a two-way radio.</p>
<p>Looking back, as she left the orphanage, Judy could
see a group of children who had stopped their play to
watch her. She called out a brief greeting and hurried
on. A strange feeling had taken possession of her. She
felt she had cheated Peter out of an interesting assignment.
Was that his official car pulling up to the side of
the road? It was. He and another agent stepped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter! I&rsquo;ve gone and done it again,&rdquo; she told
him penitently. &ldquo;We just brought Danny home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Where was he all
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy would have said more, but the other agent
broke in with, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better question him, anyway,&rdquo;
and Peter agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he tells you more than he did us,&rdquo; Judy
called after them as they started up the walk toward
the orphanage.</p>
<p>Afterwards she wondered why Peter hadn&rsquo;t asked
her about the lady table leg. Neither of the two agents
had questioned Horace. It was probably just as well.
He was in a hurry to get home and let her drive while
he sat and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter can have those beavers for all I care. One dip
in their pond was enough for me,&rdquo; he complained
from within the folds of his blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; Judy told him, &ldquo;but the matron
says the police helped her look for Danny at the beaver
dam. I told Peter he was there all night, but maybe
he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His answer, as I remember it, was &lsquo;sort of,&rsquo;&rdquo; Horace
reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that house weren&rsquo;t all boarded up I&rsquo;d think he
stayed there. He says he used to live there, and Miss
Hanley says she knew the man who lived there years
ago. Could it be Danny&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; Judy wondered.
&ldquo;Could that be why she&rsquo;s so fond of Danny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable,&rdquo; Horace commented.</p>
<p>But, to Judy, it was more than reasonable, it was romantic.
She looked forward to discussing it with
Peter. He had a way with small boys. Perhaps Danny
would confide in him. Judy wondered about Danny&rsquo;s
mother. Why had his father deserted Meta Hanley to
marry her? And where was he now?</p>
<p>Judy was still puzzling over these questions when
she and Horace arrived in Farringdon. She drove
straight to the Bolton home on Grove Street. They
had gone back to the beaver dam, she told her
mother, and Horace had accidentally fallen in the
pond. Nothing was said about the leg of the lady
table.</p>
<p>After a hot lunch, with Mrs. Bolton hovering over
both of them, Judy left for her home in Dry Brook
Hollow, and Horace returned to the newspaper office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story there,&rdquo; he insisted as they parted.
&ldquo;That boy wasn&rsquo;t telling us everything he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A Born Crusader</h2>
<p>Judy agreed with her brother. Instead of solving
everything, their trip had only deepened the mystery.
It was hard for her to concentrate on other things such
as the library exhibit. At home, as she sorted the school
cards and mementos for September, she pondered
over everything that had happened that day and the
day before.</p>
<p>First there had been the stolen typewriter. What
happened to it and whether or not it really had been
stolen remained a mystery. The green car Horace had
seen racing through Farringdon wasn&rsquo;t much of a clue
since he hadn&rsquo;t noticed the license number. He did
seem to recollect a couple of sixes in it, but he couldn&rsquo;t
be sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meta Hanley&rsquo;s car was green, and her license
number started with two sixes,&rdquo; thought Judy.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous to suppose that Miss Hanley or one
of her orphans had stolen Holly&rsquo;s typewriter. And yet
Judy had seen Horace making a note of her license
number. He made notes of everything. Even before
he became a reporter he had always kept a notebook
for his own amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to keep a notebook or a diary or <i>something</i>,&rdquo;
Judy told herself.</p>
<p>She did jot things down on little pieces of paper.
An old sales slip had been used to record the license
number of that other green car parked alongside
Hugh Sammis&rsquo; used-furniture shop. Remembering
how unfair he had been, Judy decided to call up her
father and ask about him. It was Mrs. Bolton who
answered the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Judy asked over the wire, &ldquo;does Dad
have a patient named Hugh Sammis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The used-furniture dealer? His wife is your
father&rsquo;s patient,&rdquo; Mrs. Bolton said. &ldquo;She fell on the ice
last winter and broke her hip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she still use crutches?&rdquo; asked Judy, thinking
of the noises she had heard upstairs in the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she does. It takes time for bones to knit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he owe Dad money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but your father is willing to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Judy sighed. &ldquo;Poor Dad! He always is. If he
doesn&rsquo;t get paid at all I&rsquo;m afraid it will be my fault.
I should have told you about this when we were
there, Mother. Mr. Sammis accused me of breaking
a table. He says he won&rsquo;t pay Dad until I give him
twenty dollars. I objected because he really broke
the table himself. Then he went up to twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like him.&rdquo; Mrs. Bolton&rsquo;s voice was bitter.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he intends to pay, anyway. That was
just an excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we should?&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s mother asked.
&ldquo;He has so many worries. Probably he&rsquo;ll just cross off
what Mr. Sammis owes as a bad debt. If he hadn&rsquo;t
found that excuse he would have found some other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy girl,&rdquo; her mother said gently, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve
lived as long as I have you will realize that a great
many things in this world aren&rsquo;t fair. You can&rsquo;t right
all the wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Motherkins, but I can try to right a few
of them, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bolton gave up. Judy was a born crusader, she
said, but there was pride in her voice. She wouldn&rsquo;t
have had it any other way.</p>
<p>They talked for a few more minutes, and then
Judy went back to the work of sorting and arranging
the things she had collected. Blackberry insisted on
helping. There was a faded ribbon dangling from the
souvenir booklet she had picked up in Hugh Sammis&rsquo;
shop. Ribbons always tempted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it, Blackberry!&rdquo; Judy chided him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not a kitten any more. Books are to read, not to play
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackberry turned one of the pages with his paw,
and Judy began to laugh. He acted just as if he had
understood her. She was still laughing when Peter
came in at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Blackberry!&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;He thinks
he can read that old souvenir booklet I bought for the
library exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he does,&rdquo; chuckled Peter. &ldquo;It must be quite a
story if a cat can read it. <i>Of Mice and Men</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a story,&rdquo; Judy interrupted, laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just a list of names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter read the list and then began questioning Judy.
She had wanted to tell him about Hugh Sammis and
his queer, sheared-off house. Now she found herself
coming to some odd conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she asked as she hurried to prepare dinner,
&ldquo;do you think he could have been one of the men who
did the looting in Roulsville after the flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh Sammis? I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Peter replied
soberly. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t live in this part of the country
then. That house belonged to a family by the name of
Truitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donna Truitt&rsquo;s family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. They weren&rsquo;t as well off then as they
are now. Sammis moved in and set up his shop right
after the road was widened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was lying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter looked interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About some furniture that was warped as if it had
been in the water. He said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy paused, trying to remember exactly what the
used-furniture dealer had said. He certainly had led
her to believe that his house had been sheared in half
to make room for the road. But if he had purchased
the shop just recently, that couldn&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he said about the furniture couldn&rsquo;t be true,
either,&rdquo; Judy concluded after telling Peter as much
of the conversation as she could remember. &ldquo;And if it
wasn&rsquo;t left out in the rain it could be furniture damaged
in the flood six years ago, couldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it could,&rdquo; Peter admitted.</p>
<p>Judy wanted to ask him about the lady table, but
she waited until evening, hoping he would mention it
first. Meantime she told him everything that had happened
up to the time Danny appeared and warned
Horace not to break up the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Peter,&rdquo; she ended her story, &ldquo;Danny was
afraid if Horace pulled out that table leg&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What table leg?&rdquo; Peter questioned just as if she
hadn&rsquo;t told him anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one from our table. You know, with the four
ladies holding up the marble top. One of them was in
the water. Didn&rsquo;t you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you weren&rsquo;t really sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am,&rdquo; she interrupted excitedly. &ldquo;Horace
and I both saw her this morning. Ask him if you don&rsquo;t
believe me, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Angel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I think I
understand why Danny had to watch the beaver dam.
The table leg must have been removed after you and
Horace took him back to the orphanage, and before
we got there. We looked, and I&rsquo;m certain there was no
table leg built into that dam. The water had broken
through in one place, and we could see plenty of
ripples. The beavers were probably working to repair
the damage. I told Hank Lawton&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s new to the territory. Unmarried and
willing to date young ladies who will talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, you don&rsquo;t mean Honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied mysteriously, &ldquo;we have another
young lady in mind. Donna Truitt, to be specific.
Naturally, she won&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s being of any help. It
will take time to put together all the pieces of this
puzzle, but you&rsquo;ve supplied quite a few. Have you
read the names in this souvenir booklet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read Hugh Sammis&rsquo; name. He was a boy then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was Joe Mott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gangster!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed, snatching the
booklet away from Blackberry.</p>
<p>The name, Arthur Joseph Mott, had escaped her
notice. Apparently he had dropped the Arthur. But if
he and Hugh Sammis had gone to school together
they certainly knew each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were first grade pupils then,&rdquo; Peter reminded
her. &ldquo;Do you know where all your first grade classmates
are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half of them,&rdquo; Judy replied, shaking her head.
&ldquo;I thought not. Well, if Sammis isn&rsquo;t involved in
anything dishonest,&rdquo; Peter remarked, &ldquo;he should be
willing to answer a few questions.&rdquo;</p>

<br />At the Library</h2>
<p>The next morning, Judy was at Holly&rsquo;s door soon
after Peter left with Hank Lawton in the official FBI
car. The library exhibit was ready, and she hoped her
pictures would be ready, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come with me to Roulsville?&rdquo; she asked
Holly the minute the door was opened. Ruth, as
usual, was busy with the baby. He was walking now,
and making noises that sounded like words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I!&rdquo; the younger girl exclaimed. &ldquo;But wait, I
have some more stuff for the exhibit. May I help
arrange it in the glass case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Bring your sweater. It&rsquo;s a little chilly
this morning,&rdquo; Judy said, &ldquo;and tell your sister you&rsquo;re
off for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve to be after staying home with Bobby
all day yesterday. Don&rsquo;t forget your letter,&rdquo; Ruth
advised as Holly hurried off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to my other sister. The letter, I mean,&rdquo; Holly
explained. &ldquo;I asked about my typewriter. I know
Doris didn&rsquo;t take it, but I felt better asking. It&rsquo;s funny,
but I feel closer to my sisters when they&rsquo;re away and
I just write letters. That&rsquo;s the way it was for so many
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Holly and her sisters had been separated
after their parents died, each living with a different
relative. It would take time for them to become fully
acquainted with each other. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel closer to
me when I&rsquo;m away, do you?&rdquo; Judy asked to change
the subject into more cheerful channels.</p>
<p>Holly giggled. &ldquo;Of course not. I feel closer to you
when I&rsquo;m helping you solve a mystery. Did you find
out about that thing you saw in the pond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking along the shortcut between her
house and Judy&rsquo;s. A chill was in the air. Judy shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the lady table leg? What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking <i>you</i>. But I can see you
didn&rsquo;t find out very much,&rdquo; Holly concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Judy, &ldquo;but
Peter intends to question Hugh Sammis today. He
may find out a great deal. He went with another agent
in an official car and left the Beetle for me. Put your
things in it, and I&rsquo;ll get mine. Then, on the way to
Roulsville, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>First she told Holly about the lady table leg and
how it had vanished by the time Peter got to the dam.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but Horace and
I both saw it. He was going to pull it out of the water,
and then Danny warned him not to touch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Danny?&rdquo; Holly asked. &ldquo;Do I know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about him,&rdquo; Judy reminded her.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the orphan Meta Hanley told us about. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I do,&rdquo; Holly answered. &ldquo;She said he liked to
watch the beavers. Was he there at the beaver dam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was. When we first heard him Horace
thought I was throwing my voice. Imagine! Then
he jumped down from a tree where he was hiding
and told us who he was. Horace called him a wood
sprite. He&rsquo;s such a strange little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything you&rsquo;ve told me so far is pretty
strange,&rdquo; agreed Holly. &ldquo;Did you take him back to the
orphanage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under protest. He wanted to stay and play watchman
for the beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly laughed. Then she saw that Judy was serious
and asked, &ldquo;Why would he want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a reason,&rdquo; Judy replied, &ldquo;because someone
must have removed that table leg minutes after we
left. When Peter looked for it he found a broken place
in the beaver dam and no lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an apparition,&rdquo; declared Holly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe it was there in the first place. Horace is right.
It couldn&rsquo;t have washed down from the Roulsville
flood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Horace saw it, too,&rdquo; Judy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Holly was not convinced. &ldquo;Imagination
plays strange tricks on people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy knew that. Often, passing the broken dam in
the valley above Roulsville, she seemed to see the
devastated town as she saw it right after the flood.
Today a mist hung over the valley. It was raining by
the time they reached Roulsville. Judy spread a newspaper
over the box containing the things for the
exhibit and, together, she and Holly dashed through
the rain into the library.</p>
<p>Maud Wheatley, the librarian who had rented
Judy&rsquo;s house earlier in the summer, looked a little
startled. Then she saw it wasn&rsquo;t noisy children rushing
into the library, and her expression changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Judy, and your friend, Holly Potter.
Put the things right down here on the table,&rdquo; she
directed. &ldquo;The case is empty. You may arrange them
any way you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly was a real help with her artistic ideas. The
souvenir booklet and the old textbooks were arranged
toward the back of the case with the smaller <span class="sc">Reward
of Merit</span> cards scattered in front. Judy had brought
a ball of yarn and a long needle to go with the sewing
cards, and Holly had contributed her great grandmother&rsquo;s
sampler in its antique frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be safe here, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked anxiously
when they were ready to leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly safe. The case will be locked. This is a
beautiful exhibit,&rdquo; the librarian declared. &ldquo;I knew
those treasures in your attic would make a fine display,
Judy, but this is even better than I expected. It
amazes me that a young girl like you should be so
interested in family keepsakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be because we lost so many family keepsakes
in the flood. Everything went except what few
things we had stored at Grandma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Judy told her.
&ldquo;Your home was washed away, too, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the porch. It&rsquo;s still known as the Pringle
house,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;although no Pringles live there
any more. When we went back after the flood the
rooms were empty of everything valuable. I remember
how bare the mantel looked without the old pine
clock and the chalkware lambs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chalkware lambs?&rdquo; Judy questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do you remember them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever visited your family when you
lived in that house,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but I did see
some chalkware lambs in a shop up in North Farringdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not uncommon. Whoever looted the
house left us nothing but a few chairs, a bare table, and
a kitchen stove. And the piano, but that was water-soaked
and ruined. We sold the house and rented a
furnished apartment in New York. My brother was
married that year, so there was just Mother and me.
She died soon afterwards. Losing everything was
just too much for her,&rdquo; the librarian finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never found out who did all that looting, did
you?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>She knew the answer. It seemed to distress Mrs.
Wheatley to talk about her former home. Like many
of the people who used to live in Roulsville, she had
moved away only to come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re buying one of the new houses and gradually
furnishing it with antiques,&rdquo; she confided. &ldquo;Bob can&rsquo;t
understand why I want them, but I guess I treasure
old things for the same reason you do, Judy. Thank
you for sharing your treasures with the children who
come to the library. You, too, Holly. The sampler is
yours, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it belonged to my great grandmother, Felicity
Kane. Judy helped me find out who she was. I can
help her with the October exhibit, too,&rdquo; Holly offered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a map of the world among my uncle&rsquo;s
things. It&rsquo;s the way people imagined it in the time of
Columbus with pictures of sea monsters near what
they thought was the edge of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely! Lovely!&rdquo; Mrs. Wheatley exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way since then, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full circle,&rdquo; Holly said. &ldquo;Then we were afraid of
sea monsters. Now it&rsquo;s each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girls were outside the library Judy asked,
&ldquo;Why did you say we&rsquo;re afraid of each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are,&rdquo; Holly answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean
you and me, of course. We&rsquo;re friends. But you know
yourself there are people who live by stealing and
cheating and misrepresenting what they have to sell.
Take that Mr. Sammis with his chalkware lambs.
Where do you think he got them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering about that,&rdquo; Judy admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think some of that stuff in his shop could
have been loot from the Roulsville flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. Though I should think he would have
sold it all by now,&rdquo; Judy added, &ldquo;unless he waited for
fear of being caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s waiting to sell my typewriter, too.
Oh, Judy! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you and I
could discover what he&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo; Holly exclaimed,
fairly skipping in her excitement.</p>
<p>They were on their way to pick up the films. It had
stopped raining, but there was still a chill in the air.
Summer was ending as it had begun, with Judy on the
trail of another mystery. Would the pictures she had
taken help solve it, or would they add more pieces to
the puzzle? Judy knew the answer the moment she
opened the yellow envelope that said, &ldquo;Here are your
color prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly!&rdquo; she exclaimed, nearly dropping the pictures
as she held them out for her friend to see. &ldquo;I
thought I was photographing beavers in the dark, but
look what I took!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />What the Pictures Revealed</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Holly, taking the pictures from
Judy&rsquo;s hand and flipping through them. &ldquo;I see you
didn&rsquo;t snap any beavers, just the dam and those creepy
ferns and a few ripples&mdash;but what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me what it is,&rdquo; Judy replied in a bewildered
voice as Holly stared at the last picture in
the folder.</p>
<p>It had been taken in the dark. Judy had expected
some surprises, but not anything like this. Neither she
nor Holly had the faintest notion that they were being
watched by anything but beavers. They hadn&rsquo;t
yet seen the table leg and yet, somehow, Judy had
photographed the lady&rsquo;s head so that it looked as if it
had a shadowy body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; Holly objected, studying
the picture more closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. The first thing I saw was that lady&rsquo;s face
and it&mdash;it sort of startled me,&rdquo; Judy confessed, &ldquo;but
now I think I can explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly seemed to think the picture was beyond
explanation, and no wonder! But, peering toward the
camera, was another face that Judy instantly recognized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Danny there in the ferns,&rdquo; she pointed out.
&ldquo;He and that&mdash;that man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that apparition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it must be a man, but his face is behind that
lady face as if he were wearing a mask. I started to say
that he and Danny must have been there all the time
I was trying to photograph beavers in the dark. Remember
the noises we heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly shivered. &ldquo;I remember. Now I&rsquo;m twice as
scared. You can see the beaver dam right through
the beavers. They don&rsquo;t seem real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny was real enough,&rdquo; Judy insisted. &ldquo;I told
you he had a reason for watching the beaver dam, and
this picture proves it. I must have taken another picture
on top of it to create this curious effect of the
lady&rsquo;s face, but at least it will prove to Peter that the
lady table leg was there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Holly turned the picture sideways. &ldquo;I see what you
mean, but it&rsquo;s still spooky. You have a reputation for
explaining ghosts, Judy, but this is the first time you
ever took a picture of one. Danny must have known
the man was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he did,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;When Horace and
I questioned him he said he had to watch the beavers,
but afterwards he claimed he was waiting for his
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father?&rdquo; gasped Holly. &ldquo;I thought he was an
orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know
what to think. This ghost in the picture may be the
man Meta Hanley was going to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did say his name was George, didn&rsquo;t she? They
were going to live in that house with the boarded-up
windows,&rdquo; Judy remembered, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s where
Danny said he used to live before his mother died.
Afterwards, he claims, his father closed up the house
and left him at the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s fantastic!&rdquo; Holly exclaimed. &ldquo;Did he
know Meta Hanley was the matron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he must have known it,&rdquo; Judy replied
thoughtfully as she put the folder of pictures in her
pocketbook. &ldquo;I want to show them to Peter before
anyone else sees them,&rdquo; she explained to Holly as they
headed for home.</p>
<p>On the way they talked of the old romance and
what might have happened. But it was all supposition.
They weren&rsquo;t sure of anything. They weren&rsquo;t even
sure Danny&rsquo;s father was still alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t always tell children the truth about
such things,&rdquo; Judy commented gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to tell the truth? I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Judy declared.
&ldquo;Some things are hard to face, but it&rsquo;s better to
face them. I remember when the Roulsville dam
broke. Grandma fainted when she heard it. But I ran
all the way to Roulsville to find out what really happened.
I had to know. And it wasn&rsquo;t half as bad as it
could have been. We lost our homes, but we had each
other, and now it begins to look as if we might recover
a few of our belongings as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Holly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be so happy
for you, Judy. It was just the other way around with
me. We kept our precious old things but lost the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your sisters,&rdquo; Judy reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m an aunt.&rdquo; Holly smiled at the thought.
&ldquo;Bobby&rsquo;s a lot of fun when I have him all to myself.
He was pretending clothespins were people the other
day and putting them to sleep under a blanket. I&rsquo;m
baby-sitting again tomorrow. What will you be doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Housework, I suppose. I&rsquo;ve let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The prospect of spending a whole day cleaning
house did not appeal to Judy. She brought out the
vacuum cleaner as soon as Holly left and started on
the living room. Blackberry glared at her through the
window. He had been shut outside all the time Judy
and Holly were arranging the library exhibit, and
now his heartless mistress was making the house horrible
with noise. The telephone rang, and Judy shut
off the vacuum cleaner to answer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all day?&rdquo; Horace&rsquo;s voice
came over the wire. &ldquo;I have news&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always have,&rdquo; Judy interrupted teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is important. The police traced the license
number of that green car, and they&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s Meta
Hanley&rsquo;s car we saw racing through Farringdon right
after Holly&rsquo;s typewriter was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been,&rdquo; Judy protested. &ldquo;Her car
was parked in front of the Jewell sisters&rsquo; house all day
while they were picking apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the orchard?&rdquo; Horace wanted to know.</p>
<p>Judy couldn&rsquo;t remember seeing any orchard. Perhaps
it was just over the hill. Could the thief have
borrowed Meta Hanley&rsquo;s car and returned it before
the three women had finished picking apples? Horace
thought it was quite likely. He asked how the pictures
came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see them to believe it,&rdquo; Judy told
him, &ldquo;but Peter gets the first look. &rsquo;Bye, Horace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy put away the vacuum cleaner and started
cooking dinner. The lamb pot pie was ready just as
Peter arrived home.</p>
<p>Blackberry came in with him. Both of them looked
hungry. Judy greeted Peter and handed him the pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what you think of them,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Dinner was eaten in comparative silence. Judy was
bursting with curiosity, but she wanted Peter to be the
first to comment on the amazing picture she had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crust,&rdquo; he finally said, taking another helping
of the lamb pie, &ldquo;makes it difficult for me to tell
exactly what I&rsquo;m eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does that mean?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the same way with that picture you took.
With one face on top of the other, it&rsquo;s hard to tell
just who was at the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny was, and that is the lady table leg. I told
you it was there, but that other face is hidden. I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to be. Whoever it is,&rdquo; declared Peter,
&ldquo;it answers a question that has been in my mind ever
since we talked with Danny. He wasn&rsquo;t alone at the
beaver dam all night. Someone was with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll tell you who it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may. I&rsquo;ll question him later,&rdquo; Peter decided.
&ldquo;First I&rsquo;d like to find out if anything more has been
taken from the beaver dam. I&rsquo;m convinced he was
watching it for fear someone would break it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; declared Judy, &ldquo;but in the
picture Danny is watching the man, not the beaver
dam. See the way he&rsquo;s crouched among the ferns. The
man, whoever he is, may not have known he was
there. I thought at first it might be his father, but it
was <i>after</i> this picture was taken that he said he had to
wait for his father, wasn&rsquo;t it? He wouldn&rsquo;t have said
that if they had already met each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Peter acknowledged. &ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll
do, Angel. I&rsquo;ll take this picture to the office tomorrow
and have it blown up and separated. Then we&rsquo;ll take a
little ride out to the beaver dam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and me?&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t take any other girl,&rdquo; Peter
replied to tease her. &ldquo;Old Blackberry can come along,
too. He looks as if you&rsquo;d hurt his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy giggled. &ldquo;I used the vacuum cleaner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Then you won&rsquo;t have any housework to do
tomorrow, and we can get an early start. Bring that
camera of yours along,&rdquo; Peter added, his blue eyes
twinkling. &ldquo;Maybe this time you can photograph
beavers instead of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />Together</h2>
<p>Judy and Peter set out early the next morning to
take the &ldquo;ghost picture,&rdquo; as they both called it, to
Farringdon and leave it for the experts to figure out.
Judy kept the original print. New prints would be
made from the film. They would be flashed on a
screen both before and after being separated. Peter
would see them, but Judy knew she would not be included
in the secret work of identifying the unknown
man. It was enough to be included in Peter&rsquo;s
plans for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officially, we&rsquo;re supposed to question Danny.
We&rsquo;ll stop at the orphanage first and then drive on to
the beaver dam.&rdquo; Peter began making plans. &ldquo;Meantime
the experts will be unscrambling that picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be taking a few more,&rdquo; Judy broke in.
&ldquo;This time I intend to see what I&rsquo;m taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bright, sunny day. The ride out of Dry
Brook Hollow over the hills and down again into
Farringdon was pleasant and uneventful. The little
city hadn&rsquo;t changed the way Roulsville had. There
was a new high school because the old one had burned,
and a new post office simply because it was needed.
The library was the same red brick building Judy had
learned to love when she went to the old high school
in Farringdon. It didn&rsquo;t have any glass cases for displays&mdash;just
rows and rows of books. Judy stopped in
to browse among them while Peter took the film of
the &ldquo;ghost picture&rdquo; to the FBI Resident Agency across
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Judy! This is like old times,&rdquo; someone greeted
her as she walked between the rows of books.</p>
<p>It was Lois Farringdon-Pett but, instead of being
with Lorraine as she always used to be, her new friend
Donna Truitt was with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for decorating ideas,&rdquo; Lois confided.
&ldquo;Donna&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s bought one of those Victorian
houses on Grove Street, and it has to be furnished
with period pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have things, but not the <i>right</i> things,&rdquo;
Donna put in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve moved around too much. My
father&rsquo;s business keeps him on the move, but he says
this time we&rsquo;re in Farringdon to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lived here before, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Judy questioned.
&ldquo;Where Mr. Sammis&rsquo; antique shop is now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>She knew the answer. But Donna wouldn&rsquo;t admit
that she had ever lived in the poorer section of North
Farringdon or that Mr. Sammis had bought what used
to be the Truitt house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lived in Ulysses before we moved here,&rdquo; she
insisted. &ldquo;Of course, I know the shop you mean. I
stopped there to look at some of his antiques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has some nice things,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but
his shop is so crowded it&rsquo;s hard to find them. Some of
his furniture has been broken and then mended, and
some of it is warped. I don&rsquo;t think any of it would be
right for one of those Grove Street houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has other stuff, Judy,&rdquo; Lois told her. &ldquo;That
shop you visited isn&rsquo;t his only place of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where his other shops are?&rdquo; Judy
questioned.</p>
<p>Lois shook her head. Donna claimed not to know
either, but, from the way she pulled Lois away, Judy
felt she was avoiding further questions. When Judy
was in the car again she mentioned it to Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donna Truitt won&rsquo;t avoid the questions Hank
Lawson asks her on their date tonight,&rdquo; declared
Peter. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to question Sammis, too. It&rsquo;s better
if he doesn&rsquo;t suspect you have any interest in anything
he has to sell, or in any of his other shops. We&rsquo;ll find
them without arousing his suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Judy understood what Peter meant. They passed
the sheared-off house without slowing down, Judy in
the front seat beside Peter and Blackberry in his usual
place next to the back window. The cat seemed to
be enjoying the scenery as, one after another, the
small towns along the way were reached and passed.</p>
<p>At the watershed Peter stopped long enough to
point out the far-off river valleys that lost themselves
among the blue hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back there,&rdquo; he said, indicating a wooded slope
beyond the little town named Gold, &ldquo;is the head of the
Allegheny. If we took that road to the right we&rsquo;d
cross a branch of the Susquehanna, and just ahead,
before we get to the orphanage, is a bridge over the
Genessee. Confusing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful is the word,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;I mean
that three great river systems originate within a few
miles of each other right here in our own Pennsylvania
hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew that the furniture the beavers had built
into their dam couldn&rsquo;t have floated upstream and
been transported overland by beavers. People must
have transported it before the beavers found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where was it all this time?&rdquo; Judy wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Peter promised after talking over
Judy&rsquo;s theory. &ldquo;It must have been stored or dumped
somewhere near the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Danny will know,&rdquo; Judy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Danny knows and what he&rsquo;s willing to tell
are two different stories,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;He may be
playing detective himself. On the other hand, he may
be trying to protect someone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father?&rdquo; Judy questioned. &ldquo;At first I thought
that might be his father in the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be.&rdquo; Peter planned to question Danny
about it, but when they stopped at the orphanage
they were told that the boy was off again on one of
his expeditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never tells me where he&rsquo;s going, but he knows
that I know he always goes to the beaver dam,&rdquo; the
matron confided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;If he used to live in
that house with the boarded-up windows he might go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meta Hanley shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.
The house is locked. Danny told me himself that he
wished he could get in. All the Andersons&rsquo; things are
stored there. George Anderson is supposed to return
and make a home for Danny, but he never comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working. Danny showed me a letter from
him,&rdquo; one of the orphans spoke up. There were always
little groups of them standing around, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had a Canadian stamp on it,&rdquo; another orphan
volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the matron agreed. &ldquo;Danny&rsquo;s father is working
in Canada. He writes to him regularly, but Danny
never shows me the letters. A ten-year-old has a right
to some privacy. His mother, as you know, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know.&rdquo; Judy agreed with Meta Hanley about
Danny&rsquo;s right to privacy, and yet she felt sure the
matron must be curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask Danny,&rdquo; was all she could say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Judy couldn&rsquo;t help wondering how Miss Hanley
really felt about Danny&rsquo;s father. Afterwards, in the
car, Judy and Peter talked over the old romance.
Could something unexpected have happened to prevent
George Anderson from keeping his appointment
at the beaver dam?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meta told me she expected him to bring her wedding
ring. He never brought it,&rdquo; declared Judy, &ldquo;and
only a few months afterwards she read in the paper
that he was married to the girl who became Danny&rsquo;s
mother. They lived in the house she had thought
would be hers. There it is!&rdquo; she broke off to exclaim
as the house with the boarded-up windows came in
sight. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look lonely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stopped the car. &ldquo;Lonely, perhaps, but not
deserted. You can see where a truck has been driven
into the garage just recently. For all I know, it&rsquo;s still
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s explore the place and find out!&rdquo; Judy said
eagerly.</p>
<p>Blackberry seemed eager to do some exploring, too.
Before Judy could stop him, the cat was out of the car
and off in the direction of the mysterious house. In a
moment, he had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, kitty! Kitty! Kitty!&rdquo; Peter called, but the
cat did not reappear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;He never comes unless he thinks you have food,&rdquo;
Judy reminded him. &ldquo;Cats aren&rsquo;t like dogs. They&rsquo;re
independent and adventurous, and I don&rsquo;t blame
Blackberry one bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t come, either, if you
called me away from a mystery, and I think he&rsquo;s
found one inside that house. How do you suppose he
got in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out,&rdquo; Peter suggested.</p>
<p>Judy followed him around to the back of the house
where a sagging porch seemed to have been partly
destroyed by beavers. Now she could hear Blackberry
inside the house. Or was that Blackberry? If it was, he
was playing with something that made a rolling sound
along the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s found a spool. You&rsquo;ll never get him
out of there if he&rsquo;s found something to play with,&rdquo;
Peter predicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had to get in there some way. If we can find an
opening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy stopped with her sentence half finished because,
in almost the same moment, she and Peter had
found it. The back door was locked, but there beside
it was a small hole gnawed by beavers. It was
large enough for a cat or a beaver to squeeze through,
but not for a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s large enough for a table leg, too!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed,
bending to measure the space with her
hand. &ldquo;Peter, <i>this</i> must be where the beavers found all
that furniture they built into their dam, but what&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching in a little farther, Judy&rsquo;s fingers closed
over the small, round object Blackberry had been
rolling on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A Band of Gold</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Peter as Judy held the object
in her closed hand.</p>
<p>She smiled at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to guess, but I&rsquo;ll
give you a hint. It&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t need. I already
have one, and I love it dearly. You gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave you Blackberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. This is the thing he was rolling around in
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spool of thread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! This is something much more exciting. I
know a song about it. We have it on an old record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Judy began to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s not a sudden romance</p>
<p class="t0">Or the kiss that follows a dance.</p>
<p class="t0">Love is forever, an everlasting thing.</p>
<p class="t0">Love is....&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;A golden ring.&rdquo; Peter finished the line as Judy
opened her hand.</p>
<p>There it was&mdash;a plain band of gold. It was not
engraved on the outside as Judy&rsquo;s ring was. She had
once told Peter that the leaves engraved on her wedding
ring looked like little <i>y&rsquo;s</i>. &ldquo;They all stand for
<i>you</i>,&rdquo; she had whispered after he had placed the ring
on her finger.</p>
<p>This ring, Judy soon discovered, had never been
placed on anyone&rsquo;s finger. The engraving on the inside
told the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! There are some initials there!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed,
noticing them first. &ldquo;Can you see what they
are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the ring in a better light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;G. A. to M. H.,&rsquo;&rdquo; he read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s George Anderson to Meta Hanley!&rdquo;
Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;He did buy her the ring. He really
did intend to marry her. But then I guess he met this
other girl, and love didn&rsquo;t turn out to be such an
everlasting thing for him. Meta ought to know about
the ring, though. Shall we take it to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Angel. That ring isn&rsquo;t all we&rsquo;ve discovered,&rdquo;
declared Peter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, before we
deliver the ring, we ought to find out what else is in
this house and how it came to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;Oh dear!&rdquo; Judy interrupted herself,
knowing too well what Peter meant. &ldquo;You mean
Danny&rsquo;s father may have been hiding all that loot
from the Roulsville flood in his boarded-up house. If
the beavers hadn&rsquo;t broken in&mdash;Oh dear!&rdquo; Judy said
again. &ldquo;I almost wish they hadn&rsquo;t. It spoils that beautiful
romance I was dreaming up for Meta Hanley.
She won&rsquo;t want to marry a thief. She won&rsquo;t even
want this ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may. If she really loved him she may want to
marry him, anyway, and Danny does need a
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his father will be in jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;We have to find him before we can
put him there, or marry him off, either. I think Danny
knew the beavers were hauling stuff away from the
house where he used to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! Then he knew his father stole it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are all those <i>oh dears</i> for Danny? I feel sorry for
the boy myself,&rdquo; Peter admitted. &ldquo;But perhaps his
father allowed the stuff to be stored in his house without
knowing it was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. He can&rsquo;t be much good,&rdquo; declared
Judy. &ldquo;He did leave his boy at the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Peter replied in that calm voice he used
when he was begging Judy to be reasonable, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t blame him for that, can you? He may have
known Meta Hanley was the matron and that she
would be a second mother to Danny. He must be in
these woods somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been walking toward the beaver dam
while they were talking. Judy glanced back along the
road they had taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry isn&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;I thought
surely he&rsquo;d follow us if we started walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still exploring that house. We&rsquo;ll stop and call
him again on our way back to the car,&rdquo; Peter promised.
&ldquo;Meanwhile we may surprise the beavers and
get a few good pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy had her camera with her, but she had lost
interest in the beavers. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t find them gnawing
down trees,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They find it easier to haul
broken pieces of furniture through that hole they
gnawed in the house. If Danny knows the furniture
is there,&rdquo; she went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;m sure he
must know it&rsquo;s stolen. Probably it&rsquo;s being sold, little
by little, by unscrupulous men like Mr. Sammis. It&rsquo;s
funny, though, Sammis did tell that truck driver to
take the furniture back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What furniture?&rdquo; asked Peter, suddenly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I&rsquo;m not sure it was furniture,
but just as we were leaving that second-hand shop a
truck drove up. It had the name <span class="sc">JOHN BEER</span> lettered
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the license plates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were New York plates,&rdquo; Judy replied.
&ldquo;John Beer was trying to sell Sammis some furniture.
I thought at first it might be display cases or something
he&rsquo;d made, because it said on the truck that he
was a carpenter. But now I remember hearing him
say, &lsquo;This is good furniture. I&rsquo;ve sanded and refinished
everything&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the truck came from New York State?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have.&rdquo; Judy began to see the importance
of what she had just told Peter. If stolen goods had
been transported across state lines it would be his
duty, not only to report it, but to act upon his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive to the nearest telephone and be right
back,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;You wait for me at the beaver
dam. If you see Danny maybe you can get him to
talk. Keep this picture and show it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;ghost picture&rsquo;!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed as Peter
handed it to her. &ldquo;What do you want me to do, scare
him to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;It may give him a jolt. But you can
explain the lady&rsquo;s face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot easier than I can explain some other things,&rdquo;
Judy finished.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t think of the woods as being lonely until
Peter was gone. The beaver dam, robbed of its lady,
was nothing but a mass of mud and sticks. Ripples
on the surface of the pond told her the beavers were
there. They hadn&rsquo;t dragged out any more furniture to
repair their dam. They had moved a stone. Or had
someone moved it for them?</p>
<p>Suddenly Judy became uneasy. She had been keeping
perfectly still with her camera focused on the
pond. Now she whirled around with it as something
moved in the bushes behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a beaver,&rdquo; she said to herself, relief flooding
over her. She had imagined the man in the &ldquo;ghost
picture&rdquo; stealing stealthily through the woods. But
that was silly. Peter wouldn&rsquo;t have left her if there had
been any danger. Without moving from where she
stood, she began to take pictures.</p>
<p>Soon two more beavers appeared carrying poles. A
crash in the woods off to her right told her that another
sapling had fallen. If beavers worked only at
night, these animals were breaking the rules. Judy
watched them for half an hour and then, as suddenly
as they had appeared, the beavers vanished. Something
had startled them. Was it Blackberry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, kitty! Kitty! Kitty!&rdquo; Judy began to call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; a voice hissed from the tree overhead.</p>
<p>Judy looked up to see Danny looking more like a
wood sprite than ever in his green jacket. His eyes
pierced through her as if they were accusing her of
invading his private world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only calling my cat,&rdquo; she started to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; Danny declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Judy wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I trapped him. That&rsquo;s why. I&rsquo;ll trap anything
or anybody who goes in that house without my
father&rsquo;s permission,&rdquo; declared Danny. &ldquo;I plugged up
the hole and trapped him. That&rsquo;s what I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cruel!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a cat. I&rsquo;m
going right back there this minute and let him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; Danny sprang down from the
tree and seized her arm, but not before she found the
&ldquo;ghost picture&rdquo; and held it before his face. She didn&rsquo;t
care if she did give him a jolt. All her sympathy on
him had been wasted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a vicious little monster,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He
deserves to be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not prepared for the quick change of expression
or the sudden loosening of his grasp on her
arm. He snatched the picture and held it in a patch of
sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got him!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Or is it a her? You
got that man I was following, and he has a lady&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognize the face?&rdquo; Judy asked
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the face that was on that lady stick. Somebody
did steal it,&rdquo; the boy charged. &ldquo;If you and your
brother hadn&rsquo;t taken me back to the orphanage I
could have watched the beaver dam. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t
have been broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that,&rdquo; Judy said, meaning it.
&ldquo;You know my brother didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo; Danny retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Maybe it was that
guy in the picture. I&rsquo;m going to tell my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look closely, Danny,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;I took
one picture on top of another. Isn&rsquo;t that your father in
the second picture?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />Danny&rsquo;s Confession</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; Danny repeated with a dazed expression
on his face. &ldquo;You mean that man I&rsquo;ve been following
is my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Judy said, torn between sympathy
and anger. Her arm was beginning to turn
black and blue where the boy had held it. &ldquo;You must
know who was with you that night you stayed at the
beaver dam. Or didn&rsquo;t you stay there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all the time,&rdquo; Danny confessed. &ldquo;Some of the
time I was watching the house. That man has a key.
He goes in and out whenever he pleases, but if he <i>is</i>
my father it&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could Judy say? It was all wrong whoever
the man was. Danny seemed to sense it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;But my father would come and see me,&rdquo; he objected
to his own reasoning. &ldquo;And how can he send me
letters from Canada if he&rsquo;s right here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are all his letters from Canada?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>Danny had started walking back toward the house
that used to be his home. Judy followed him. He
walked a little way before he answered. &ldquo;All but the
last one. That was just a note. It didn&rsquo;t have any
stamp on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it go through the mail without a
stamp?&rdquo; Judy wondered.</p>
<p>Danny looked back at her. &ldquo;Are you following me
just to ask questions?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let my cat out. You said you shut
him in the house. But I would like an answer to my
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the letter, you mean? I guess it could have
been inside another letter, couldn&rsquo;t it? Maybe my
father wrote to tell Ma he was coming. We always call
the matron Ma,&rdquo; Danny explained. &ldquo;All the orphans
do except the new ones. Some of them won&rsquo;t talk at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Danny interrupted. &ldquo;I was, too. I was only
four years old when my mother died and my father
took me away in his car. He only took me as far as
the orphanage. Then he said, &lsquo;Get out!&rsquo; in a sort of
funny voice. &lsquo;Go on up to the door,&rsquo; he told me. So
I did. By the time Ma opened it my father was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the last time you saw him?&rdquo; Judy
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Danny nodded. He and Judy were walking together
now. Through the trees, they could see the
house with the boarded-up windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows weren&rsquo;t like that when we lived
there,&rdquo; Danny went on talking. &ldquo;You could see out,
and people on the outside could see in. It will be like
that again when my father comes home. I don&rsquo;t remember
him very well, but I do know he promised
to come back when I was ten. He keeps reminding me
of it in his letters. He said by then he&rsquo;d have a lot of
money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say where he&rsquo;d get it, did he?&rdquo; Judy
interrupted to ask.</p>
<p>Danny&rsquo;s eyes blazed at her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d work for it, of
course. Where else would he get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was getting in deeper and deeper. She wished
Peter would come back. He would know what questions
to ask and how to answer those that the boy
fired at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; Danny continued, eager to talk about it
now, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d work hard and save money and when
I was ten years old we&rsquo;d go back to the old house,
and everything would be the way it was when Mother
was alive. But it isn&rsquo;t! The things in the house are all
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I mean,
how can you tell when you can&rsquo;t get in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because those things the beavers dragged out aren&rsquo;t
our things. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> they are. You said
that lady stick was a leg from your table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was,&rdquo; Judy replied quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Danny! I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m just as puzzled as
you are,&rdquo; Judy told him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we be friends? Can&rsquo;t
we work out this puzzle together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it&rsquo;s going to get my father in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly. Peter was coming toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody shut Blackberry in the house,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;I unplugged the hole but I couldn&rsquo;t coax him
out. Who do you suppose could have done a thing
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy looked at Danny expecting him to answer, but
he had his head down. He seemed to be very much interested
in tying the lace on one of his sneakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it matters. Old Blackberry wasn&rsquo;t
complaining. I think he&rsquo;s found a mouse or two in
there to keep him busy until we come back for him.
Come on, everybody,&rdquo; Peter urged as he hurried them
toward the car. &ldquo;The important thing right now is
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch?&rdquo; Danny questioned as if he had never
heard the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, aren&rsquo;t you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved,&rdquo; the boy admitted. &ldquo;Where will we
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Peter smiled. &ldquo;I guess the Beverly&rsquo;s the nearest place
unless you want to go back to the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They eat at twelve. The dining room closes at one.
It&rsquo;s after that, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Danny asked.</p>
<p>Peter consulted his watch. &ldquo;Way after. It&rsquo;s nearly
two. Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beverly turned out to be an old mansion made
over into an inn. It was quiet in the daytime, but Judy
could see that it must be quite a gay place at night.
There was a dance floor and a platform for an orchestra
as well as separate dining rooms for private
parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> a surprise!&rdquo; she exclaimed as they entered
through the lobby and stood looking into the dining
room. &ldquo;I never expected to find a place like this way
out here in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so far out in the country as you may think,&rdquo;
Peter told her. &ldquo;This road follows the Genessee River
north to Wellsville and on to Rochester. It crosses
Route 17, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised to find a
sign at the crossroads directing tourists here. Like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love it,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to come here
some evening when the place is more lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny bounced on one of two sofas opposite each
other. &ldquo;Golly! You could sleep on this,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this furniture for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For people to sit on, of course,&rdquo; Judy replied,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when they&rsquo;re waiting for other people?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or when they want to rest. It&rsquo;s sort of a living
room for people who stay overnight here. Hotels always
have lobbies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would my father stay overnight here if he came to
see me?&rdquo; Danny interrupted, as they followed the
waiter to a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy and Peter looked at each other. Neither of
them wanted to say anything against Danny&rsquo;s father.
Finally, just as they were finishing lunch, Danny produced
the note his father had written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he said, fishing a crumpled piece of
paper out of his pocket. &ldquo;See what it says! &lsquo;<i>I am keeping
my promise. I think I have money enough to start
a good business. We&rsquo;ll operate from our own home.
I&rsquo;ll take you back there to live with me very
soon....</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s typewritten!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. She couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking of Holly&rsquo;s stolen typewriter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny,&rdquo; Peter asked, his voice grave, &ldquo;have you
any idea what this business is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. He seemed as confused as
they were. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s farming, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound
much like it. Whatever it is, he wants me to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you helped him, Danny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;No-oo,&rdquo; was the reply to Peter&rsquo;s question. Danny
sounded a little uncertain. He couldn&rsquo;t be the boy who
ran off with Holly&rsquo;s typewriter. Horace had judged
that boy to be about sixteen or seventeen. Judy
thought of the matron&rsquo;s car. Could it have been &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;
by Danny&rsquo;s father that day Miss Hanley and
the Jewell sisters were picking apples? Certainly someone
had taken it and then returned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you haven&rsquo;t seen your father since
he left this note?&rdquo; Peter continued his questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have. Maybe he was the man I was trailing,&rdquo;
Danny admitted. &ldquo;I thought that man had no
right to go in our house, and so I spied on him. I didn&rsquo;t
speak to him. I didn&rsquo;t say one word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know you were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I heard him muttering something
about the beavers. It wasn&rsquo;t a very nice thing to say.
I don&rsquo;t think my father would talk like that. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Danny finished answering Peter&rsquo;s question, Judy
failed to hear what he said. The sentence was suddenly
drowned out by the shrill sound of a siren that
grew increasingly louder. Danny rushed to the window
with Judy following him. Peter joined them as
soon as he had paid for their lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fire engines!&rdquo; Danny shouted above the noise
outside. &ldquo;They must be coming from Wellsville. Let&rsquo;s
watch and see which way they turn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />Fire!</h2>
<p>Watching the fire engines from the porch, it was
easy to see which way they were going. The Beverly
Inn overlooked the valley beyond the crossroads.
Here and there a house and a piece of cleared land
broke the green carpet of trees that covered the hills
in every direction.</p>
<p>It was a quiet scene except for the red fire engines
streaking past, their sirens screaming. Judy had expected
them to turn to the west toward Ulysses. The
straight road ahead would take them to the house
with the boarded-up windows. To Judy&rsquo;s surprise
and momentary relief, they took the road to the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be too bad. There aren&rsquo;t any towns in that
direction, are there?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for quite a distance,&rdquo; Peter began. &ldquo;It may be
some country place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ours?&rdquo; Danny wailed.</p>
<p>Thinking he meant his old home, Judy started to
reassure him. But first she knew she must reassure herself.
She liked excitement, but not the excitement of
fires. Memories rushed back&mdash;her old school burning,
the crackling flames when a fire was deliberately set to
halt the rebuilding of Roulsville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out where it is,&rdquo; Peter promised. &ldquo;Come
on, Judy. We have to go that way to take Danny back
to the orphanage. We may as well see what&rsquo;s burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be a forest fire?&rdquo; Judy questioned when
they were in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be. I hope it isn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve had too much
dry weather lately. Whatever it is,&rdquo; Peter declared,
&ldquo;the firemen will have to work fast to keep it from becoming
a forest fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that funny cloud?&rdquo; Danny asked, peering
out of the car window.</p>
<p>Peter slowed down to let more fire engines pass
and then followed them. Now Judy could see the
cloud Danny had mentioned. But was it a cloud?
White wisps of smoke curled into the sky like scrawny
ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be where the fire is,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Right
there in the valley beyond the trees&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s where the orphanage is!&rdquo; Danny objected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Judy gasped. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe the orphanage
was burning. The thought of all those children
losing the one home they had was too much.
Other thoughts, still more terrifying, quickly followed.
Peter, not having any word of reassurance,
drove on in silence. Suddenly Danny screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it now. It is the orphanage! We have to
get Ma out of there. She&rsquo;ll go in after the babies and
never come out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Danny! Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;The
firemen will make sure that Ma and all the children
are safe, won&rsquo;t they, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do their best,&rdquo; he replied, heading straight
for the burning building, &ldquo;but they can use all the
help we can give them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy agreed. As soon as Peter stopped the car she
sprang out and started toward the orphanage. The
windows glowed with a weird red light. The whole
interior must be ablaze. Oh, Judy hoped all the children
were out! Her one thought was to find Meta
Hanley and tell her Danny was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the matron?&rdquo; she asked a group of frightened
orphans who were huddled together watching
the firemen as they worked to keep the fire from
spreading to the woods. They had been too late to
save the building. Tongues of flame leaped through
the upper windows and suddenly burst through the
roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to burn to the ground!&rdquo; one small girl
wailed. &ldquo;Then where will we live?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Miss?&rdquo; The group turned to Judy
without answering the child&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we
do if the firemen can&rsquo;t save anything? All our
clothes are in there. We were in the dining room when
it happened. Ma wouldn&rsquo;t let us go back upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; an older boy put
in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all safe, but where will we live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find you a place,&rdquo; Judy replied hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the orphans agreed. &ldquo;Ma will think
of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there!&rdquo; The oldest orphan pointed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
trying to keep that man from going back into the
building. He helped carry the babies out. Why do you
think he wants to go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Judy promised.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wind changed, and a dense cloud of
smoke swirled downward from the burning orphanage.
When it cleared Judy found, to her dismay, that
she had lost sight of the matron and the man who had
helped rescue the babies. She glanced back at Peter and
saw that he was busy keeping people away from the
fire. He didn&rsquo;t seem to be paying any attention to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she called above the crackling and roaring
of the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s a man in there. He was
trying to go back. Leave Danny there and help me
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him, miss,&rdquo; one of the firemen reassured
her. &ldquo;That is, if he&rsquo;s in there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>He started toward the orphanage. Judy hesitated a
moment. Peter hadn&rsquo;t heard her call. Should she follow
the fireman? The smoke was so dense she could
hardly see which way he had gone.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was startled by someone brushing
past her. At the same moment she saw the matron.
Two firemen were with her. Judy and the man who
was trying to pass her were jerked back just in time. A
heavy beam crashed in what would have been their
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what would have happened if we&rsquo;d let you go
in there!&rdquo; Meta Hanley pointed out. &ldquo;Oh! There
goes the roof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo; the firemen warned as the flames
roared upward, shooting sparks in every direction.</p>
<p>It was surprising how quickly people gathered to
watch the fire. The crowd surged back, Judy along
with them. Shaken by her narrow escape, she was glad
to follow the advice of the firemen. Only the man resisted.
It took all three firemen to hold him. The one
who had gone ahead of Judy returned from another
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; the man shouted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy in
there. He&rsquo;ll burn to death if I don&rsquo;t get him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, sir,&rdquo; the fireman insisted. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t a living soul in that building. I counted heads,
and everyone is out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone except my son! Where is he?&rdquo; the distraught
father demanded. &ldquo;Why are you trying to deceive
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t deceive you, George,&rdquo; Meta Hanley
replied quietly. She spoke as if continuing an earlier
conversation. &ldquo;I told you he didn&rsquo;t come home for
lunch. He went over to the beaver dam early this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="caption"><i>A heavy beam crashed in Judy&rsquo;s path.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have come back! He may have gone inside!
Danny! Danny!&rdquo; the man shouted.</p>
<p>Judy stepped up to him. She had heard enough.
&ldquo;Your son is too far away to hear you, Mr. Anderson,
but he&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; she said, sure now that the man really
was Danny&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;The fireman is right. All the
children are accounted for. Your son is with my husband.
Wait here, and I&rsquo;ll bring him over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy hurried off to where Peter and Danny stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Peter demanded. He
had not seen her follow the fireman toward the burning
building, but he could tell, from her sooty face,
that she had been too near the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to try to keep a man from going back
in. Peter, it was Danny&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; she rushed on, &ldquo;and
he wants to see Danny right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to see <i>him</i>, not if he&rsquo;s a thief,&rdquo;
Danny spoke up unexpectedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay
with Ma. No house at all is better than a house with
stolen furniture in it. And if he cares so much about
me, why didn&rsquo;t he come to see me instead of sneaking
around looking for the stuff the beavers stole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question, Danny,&rdquo; Peter told him
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s such a good question, why aren&rsquo;t we
over there finding out the answers?&rdquo; Judy urged.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Danny said, pulling back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.
If he&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;ve been following around, I don&rsquo;t
like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny, give him a chance,&rdquo; Judy pleaded. &ldquo;Maybe
he can explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he&rsquo;s the man in the ghost picture. I know
what <i>he</i> was up to. I heard him swearing and muttering
to himself when his back was turned. I&rsquo;d rather
not see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to see him.&rdquo; Peter was firm
at first, but at the heartsick look Danny gave him, he
relented. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he agreed with a meaning
glance at Judy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re all right. He
had reason to be worried. For all he knew, you could
have been trapped upstairs when the boys started the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it was started by boys?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;but Danny&rsquo;s
two friends over there admitted that they were playing
rocket with matches just before they came down
for lunch. It&rsquo;s a dangerous game, and they won&rsquo;t ever
play it again. This fire has taught them a lesson they
won&rsquo;t soon forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taught me a lesson, too,&rdquo; Danny put in. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have gone off by myself all the time. I should
have taken my friends with me. Next time I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at the two shamefaced boys Peter had
been questioning. They didn&rsquo;t smile back. They were
too close to tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, fellows,&rdquo; Danny told them. &ldquo;Ma will
see that we have another place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barn had been saved, and the fire had not
spread to the woods. Firemen were still busy wetting
down the brick skeleton of what used to be the orphanage
when the Jewell sisters drove up in an ancient
car. Dorcas was at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take six boys home with us, these three and
these three younger ones,&rdquo; she began in the commanding
voice she often used when speaking to her sister.
&ldquo;Tell Meta, will you, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Meta!&rdquo; Violetta put in. &ldquo;She has so much on
her mind, we won&rsquo;t wait to ask. She&rsquo;s sure to appreciate
anything we can do to help. We saw the smoke
from our house and came right over. All the children
are safe? Thank heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys, get in the back seat,&rdquo; Dorcas ordered,
and the six children scrambled in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye! Tell Ma where we went!&rdquo; they
shouted from the car, as Dorcas started off with a
jerk.</p>
<p>Judy turned to Peter, laughing. &ldquo;My, that was fast!
I didn&rsquo;t want Danny to leave until he&rsquo;d seen his father.
But they do have a big house with all those unused
bedrooms upstairs and that wonderful telescope
in the cupola. The boys may not want to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not have to,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;The Jewell
sisters could keep a couple of them. Foster homes may
be the answer to this emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;Of course, they are a little
old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orphans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;You know I mean the Jewell sisters,
but they do seem to be getting younger since we
solved their problems, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One less haunted house,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;Between
us we&rsquo;ve dehaunted quite a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet there is an air of mystery about all those
houses&mdash;theirs, ours, and especially the house in Farringdon.
I keep thinking how pleased Dad would be
to have some of the furniture we thought we lost in
the Roulsville flood. Even the table leg would be a
souvenir of our old home,&rdquo; Judy finished wistfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; Peter promised. &ldquo;Your picture
proves it was there in the beaver dam, and it couldn&rsquo;t
have walked away by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy shivered at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something lifelike about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puzzle
all right, but right now we have a more urgent problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Homes for the homeless. What about our
house?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;We have a lot of room. We
could take in Miss Hanley and quite a number of small
children&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off as she caught sight of the
matron and the man Judy supposed she had photographed
behind the lady&rsquo;s face. They were standing
together with quite a crowd around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dread telling him Danny went off with the Jewell
sisters,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s calmed down, but he still
looks worried. No matter what he&rsquo;s done, I feel
sorry for him. A father has a right to see his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want an explanation. I won&rsquo;t question him
just yet,&rdquo; Peter decided. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the right time or
place. Of course there is a lot still to be explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady table leg, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and whatever it was that Danny overheard.
If his father <i>is</i> that man in the ghost picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean there&rsquo;s a chance he isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Judy interrupted
excitedly. &ldquo;Oh, I hope none of the things we
suspect are true!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />Homes for the Homeless</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t think of Danny&rsquo;s father as a thief,&rdquo; Judy
resolved to herself.</p>
<p>With this resolution in her mind, she found it easier
to pass on the suggestion she had made to Peter. She
didn&rsquo;t look at Danny&rsquo;s father, but spoke directly to
Meta Hanley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jewell sisters took six of the boys home with
them. We&rsquo;ll help, too. We&rsquo;ll do anything we can, and
I&rsquo;m sure Holly will, too. We have lots of room in our
house, but not quite enough beds,&rdquo; Judy admitted,
looking around at the many orphans wandering about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Soon she discovered that she and Peter were not the
only ones to volunteer their homes to shelter the children.
Hearing that the Jewell sisters had taken some
of the boys, several more women pressed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have room for two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take one of the little tots. We have a crib upstairs.
I suppose you&rsquo;ll need clothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; another woman put in.
&ldquo;Our church was planning a rummage sale. We&rsquo;ve collected
a lot of children&rsquo;s clothing. It&rsquo;s all yours for
the asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Hanley thanked all those who were willing to
help and told them she would be glad to have them
keep the children overnight. She didn&rsquo;t know what
would be decided after that, but she said she hoped
she could keep her family together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my family, you know,&rdquo; she explained to
the people gathered around her. &ldquo;Some of them have
been with me for years and treat each other like
brothers and sisters. I hope a way will be found so
they don&rsquo;t have to be apart for more than a night or
two. I don&rsquo;t like to see them separated&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my son?&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father broke in.</p>
<p>He had been expecting Judy to return with Danny.
The moment he saw that the boy wasn&rsquo;t with her he
started firing questions at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Danny? What have you done with him?
I don&rsquo;t know who you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, George!&rdquo; Meta Hanley interrupted. &ldquo;Judy,
didn&rsquo;t you just tell me the Jewell sisters had taken
six boys home with them? Was Danny one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Judy was not allowed to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had no right!&rdquo; stormed the boy&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;A
couple of blundering old ladies drive over and kidnap
six of your boys, Meta, and you stand there and let
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a kindness!&rdquo; she retorted, angry now. &ldquo;The
children have to have a place to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kindness? Taking my boy away when I haven&rsquo;t
seen him for six long years?&rdquo; George Anderson
spoke in such a loud voice that some of the women
who had offered help backed away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no kindness!
That&rsquo;s kidnapping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute!&rdquo; Peter stopped him, &ldquo;before
you make any more charges. Your son wasn&rsquo;t kidnapped
by the Jewell sisters. And I suspect you had
plenty of opportunity to see him before the fire. He&rsquo;s
been trailing you around for days. I&rsquo;m afraid, after
what he saw and heard, he doesn&rsquo;t want to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father charged. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t have been trailing me around for days. I only
got in from Canada this morning. I was on my way
to the old house. I was going to open it up and make
a home for Danny. Then I saw the fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you haven&rsquo;t been over there to that
house with the boarded-up windows?&rdquo; Judy interrupted
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I haven&rsquo;t seen Danny. He couldn&rsquo;t have
been trailing me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was trailing somebody who had a key to
the house,&rdquo; Peter insisted. &ldquo;We found your son at the
beaver dam, and he told us all about it. He&rsquo;d missed
his lunch at the orphanage, and so we stopped at the
Beverly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you and I used to go for dinner, George,&rdquo;
Meta Hanley put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where it is,&rdquo; George Anderson snapped.
&ldquo;I thought <i>you</i> had forgotten. Maybe they&rsquo;ll make
room for these children. Or maybe I will. It&rsquo;s time I
kept my promise and took Danny home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t very good at keeping promises, are
you, George?&rdquo; Miss Hanley said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You speak of the
Beverly as if it were just any restaurant and not&mdash;You&rsquo;re
the one who didn&rsquo;t keep your promise. I had
the ring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one?&rdquo; Peter questioned, showing him the ring
Blackberry had been rolling on the floor in the
boarded-up house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that!&rdquo; George Anderson demanded.</p>
<p>After scrutinizing it with a puzzled look on his face,
he hurled back another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find this ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cat found it,&rdquo; Judy spoke up. &ldquo;He rolled it
out of a hole the beavers had gnawed in your house.
We left him still in there, and we&rsquo;d like to drive over
there with you and get him out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him out all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy didn&rsquo;t like the way Danny&rsquo;s father said that.
He glared at her a moment, reminding her of Danny.
&ldquo;I trapped him,&rdquo; the boy had said in evident satisfaction.
Was there a streak of cruelty in both of them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ring is yours, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Peter asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t believe a cat found
it. I put it away with my other valuables. It&rsquo;s the
wedding ring I bought for Meta&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George! You did buy it?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I bought it. You were with me when I
picked it out. I had to wait for it to be engraved, didn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo; Puzzlement was rapidly taking the place of anger
on the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But what is it, Meta? Why are you
suddenly so pale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, that&rsquo;s all. If you bought the ring,
why didn&rsquo;t you meet me the way you said you
would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! I was there, too. I waited and waited.&rdquo;
She paused, passing her hand across her forehead as if
the gesture might clear her confused thoughts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been such a terrible day with the fire and all these poor
children left homeless. I don&rsquo;t understand how such
things happen,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure
they <i>are</i> happening. Things do get mixed up like this in
dreams. First a nightmare with people screaming at
each other and running into burning buildings and
then an impossible ending&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Meta, you aren&rsquo;t dreaming. This impossible
ending is real.&rdquo; George Anderson&rsquo;s voice was husky.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been the mother my boy needed. I knew
you would be when I left him at the orphanage. But
now he&rsquo;s old enough to need a father, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>He sounded sincere, but Judy couldn&rsquo;t help thinking,
&ldquo;You need him, too, to help you with your business.&rdquo;
She couldn&rsquo;t forget the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father was asking.
&ldquo;Why has he turned against me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meta sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain that, George, but
Peter Dobbs is with the FBI. I called them the other
night when Danny didn&rsquo;t come home. He was at the
beaver dam. Beaver dam,&rdquo; she repeated as if trying the
sound of the word. &ldquo;I was so sure you said you&rsquo;d meet
me at the beaver dam. It was our old meeting place.
Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> remember,&rdquo; he replied, looking more bewildered
by the minute, &ldquo;but how would Danny know about
it? You didn&rsquo;t tell him, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I never said a word. Naturally
I knew he was your boy, but I loved him for himself.
I trusted him, too. When he said he was going over to
watch the beavers, I believed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he spend the night there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to ask him that question,
George,&rdquo; Meta replied quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never spoken a
word against you. If you&rsquo;re worthy of your son&rsquo;s love
I&rsquo;m sure you can win it back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Meta turned away then. Her face was so white
that Judy knew she must be near collapse. A neighbor
suggested that she lie down for a little while in her
house, but Meta protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen to the children?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that they have places to stay for the
night.&rdquo; Judy turned to Danny&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Did you
mean it when you offered your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant anything more sincerely in my
whole life,&rdquo; he declared, and Judy wouldn&rsquo;t have
doubted him if she hadn&rsquo;t caught Peter looking as if
he didn&rsquo;t know what to believe. Was George Anderson
a generous father offering his own home to the
homeless children, or was this a trick?</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />Was It All a Mistake?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; asked Judy when they were in their own
car following the lighter car driven by Danny&rsquo;s father,
&ldquo;do you think it was all a mistake? I mean about the
meeting place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beaver dam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Beverly&rsquo; don&rsquo;t sound much
alike,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;But it does look as if one of
them waited in one place and one in another. It&rsquo;s this
business of his that worries me. Well, here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny&rsquo;s father was out of his car first. He parked
it under a tree and waited for Judy and Peter a little
impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he pointed out, indicating the
boarded-up windows and the unkept yard, &ldquo;the
house is just as I expected to find it. There&rsquo;s plenty to
do. It&rsquo;s been closed for six years, but with the kids to
help, it shouldn&rsquo;t take us long to put it in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six years, did you say? That would be about the
time of the Roulsville flood, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; questioned
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About,&rdquo; George Anderson replied without a
change of expression. &ldquo;It was right after the flood, as
I recollect it. I lost my wife a short time before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on talking about his wife as they walked
toward the house. She used to live in Roulsville and
when he said her maiden name was Mary Turner,
Judy thought she remembered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to help Miss Pringle in the library, didn&rsquo;t
she? I must have been about eight years old when I
got my first library card. A girl named Mary made it
out. I remember how nicely she printed my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Mary all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke tenderly as if he had really loved her. But
he claimed he loved Meta, too. Judy supposed it was
possible to love two people at the same time although
she couldn&rsquo;t imagine herself being really in love with
anyone but Peter. Still, before their marriage, she
hadn&rsquo;t been so sure. She tried to listen sympathetically
but all the time there was that doubt in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I planned to marry Meta, but when she didn&rsquo;t
keep our date and managed to be out every time I
telephoned, what could I think? I turned to Mary for
sympathy, and it soon ripened into love. It often happens,&rdquo;
Danny&rsquo;s father declared. &ldquo;We had some good
years together. Now, after six more years, I&rsquo;m back
home again, and trying to pick up the pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>It was an unfortunate sentence. Just then Judy noticed
the pieces, not of a shattered romance, but pieces
of broken furniture. They were scattered here and
there about the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beavers,&rdquo; Peter commented. &ldquo;You can see their
trails through the tall grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t get any of that stuff from my house.
It is a mess, though,&rdquo; George Anderson admitted. &ldquo;But
the boys can help me clean up the yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His step was almost jaunty as he walked up on the
front porch and inserted his key in the lock of the
front door. It opened so easily that he gave a start
backwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought the lock
would be rusty after all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this an act, or did he really think the house had
been closed that long? He went in first and just stood
there sniffing the strong scent of varnish and glue that
filled all the rooms. Judy was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark in here,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Those
boarded-up windows keep out the daylight, but we
can use my flash&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Peter said, flicking on the light
switch and flooding the rooms with light. The dazed
owner of the house stood blinking in their bright
glare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; he finally managed to
stutter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to ask you the same question,&rdquo; replied
Peter. &ldquo;Danny showed me your note. Is this the business
you mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my boy thinks&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off there,
apparently too stunned to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Judy was a little stunned herself. The house was not
a home at all. It was a shop, complete with carpenter&rsquo;s
bench and sanding tools. To the left, as she came in,
she noticed a small office. And there on the desk, in
plain sight, sat a typewriter exactly like the one she
had given Holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this&mdash;your typewriter?&rdquo; she asked when she
could find her voice.</p>
<p>George Anderson glared at her. &ldquo;You knew this
stuff was here, didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve read about you, always
snooping around in empty houses and giving that
brother of yours ghost stories for the Farringdon paper.
You&rsquo;re Dr. Bolton&rsquo;s daughter, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy nodded. She couldn&rsquo;t speak because she had
seen what was in the corner. Either she was dreaming
or one of her ghost stories was about to come true.
For there, on top of a neat pile of chair rungs and
old rockers, was a familiar face. In fact, there were
three of them. Only one leg from the lady table was
missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Judy finally exclaimed, pointing to the
pile. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re like new, and yet I know they must be
the other three legs from our table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been refinished. The fourth leg must be
around here somewhere,&rdquo; declared Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The marble table top was there. It was leaning
against the wall waiting for the whole table to be assembled.
Judy went over and touched it to make sure
it was real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m like Meta Hanley. I think I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff is solid enough!&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father picked
up one of the table legs. &ldquo;But how in thunder did it
get in my house?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And what are all
these tools doing on the shelves where Mary used to
keep her books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Peter promised. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find your
wife&rsquo;s books, too. Were they rare books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were old books, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.
She had quite a collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Judy touched his arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a collection
of rare books in the Roulsville library. Mrs.
Wheatley bought them just recently. She could tell
you the name of the book dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books aren&rsquo;t all that&rsquo;s missing,&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father observed
as he walked through the rooms. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
enough furniture in here to fill a warehouse, but
very little of it is mine. We&rsquo;ll go upstairs later. Right
now let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door but could not enter. The way
was blocked by piles of furniture, most of it broken
and warped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he questioned, pushing tables and
chairs out of his way to make a path and growing
more furious by the minute. &ldquo;Someone has turned my
house into a shop for rebuilding old furniture. Most
of this stuff looks as if it had been through a flood!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking,&rdquo; Peter replied
evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re accusing me of stealing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I did have an idea we might find
something like this in your house,&rdquo; Peter admitted.
&ldquo;One of those carved table legs in the other room was
stolen by beavers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve heard everything!&rdquo; George Anderson
exploded. &ldquo;Next thing you&rsquo;ll be telling me beavers
walked off with my wife&rsquo;s books because they were
a little short of reading matter. You said there was a
cat in this house, too, didn&rsquo;t you? Did the cat turn
on the electricity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he was here,&rdquo; Judy began, smiling in spite
of herself. She had almost forgotten poor Blackberry
in the excitement, but he was sure to be around
somewhere. &ldquo;Your son trapped him,&rdquo; she started to
explain to Danny&rsquo;s father, but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m no cat, and you can&rsquo;t trap me,&rdquo; he broke
in furiously as he started toward the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />The Key to a Mystery</h2>
<p>The door George Anderson chose for his hasty exit
was the door to the kitchen. Peter made no move to
stop him. Neither did Judy. He was stopped by what
he saw when he flung open the door.</p>
<p>There, glittering in the bright sunlight that streamed
in through the doorway, was an overturned tobacco
jar spilling old jewelry, tie clasps, gold cuff links, and
other trinkets. Nothing of any great value appeared to
be in the collection, but it did tell the story of the ring
Blackberry had found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Judy pointed out, &ldquo;my cat did tip over
this tobacco jar and roll the ring out to us. Peter, we&rsquo;d
better find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s disappeared before,&rdquo; Peter reminded her as
they searched the house, upstairs and down. &ldquo;He always
comes back. We may find him waiting for us in
the car. I left the windows open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are really fond of that cat, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Danny&rsquo;s father asked, calming down now that he had
seen the evidence. &ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t figure out is how he
got inside my house in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We told you. He crawled in through this hole.&rdquo;
Judy pointed out a jagged opening near the kitchen
door. &ldquo;You can see it was gnawed by beavers. They
really did haul away some of this stuff to build their
dam. Your son watched them do it. But, apparently,
someone else was watching, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not accusing me again, are you?&rdquo; He was
still on the defensive, but Judy and Peter soon convinced
him they were not accusing him of anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just trying to find out the truth. You can
help us, Mr. Anderson, if you will,&rdquo; declared Peter.
&ldquo;You know where this furniture came from, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>,&rdquo; he replied with emphasis, &ldquo;but I
suspect it&rsquo;s loot from the Roulsville flood. Somebody
stored it here six years ago and set up a shop to refinish
and resell it more recently, I suppose. But it was done
without my knowledge, and I won&rsquo;t take the blame
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to, but we are asking you to help
us find out who did it,&rdquo; Peter told him. &ldquo;My wife took
a picture of him when Danny was trailing him.
Danny thinks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Danny thinks I&rsquo;m the thief, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; his father
interrupted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he refused to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know who the thief is tomorrow when I
show him this picture blown up and separated from
the one of the table leg. Do you see what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; George Anderson admitted
after taking a long look at the picture Peter handed
him. &ldquo;What is this? A joke of some kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;You might call it that, but the joke
was on me. I took one picture on top of another. It
does create a weird effect.&rdquo; She pointed out the lady&rsquo;s
face on the man&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;You see, that&rsquo;s the same face
that you saw carved on those three table legs in the
other room. One is missing. It must have been stored
here in the kitchen when the beavers found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be where all the unfinished furniture
is stored,&rdquo; Peter observed as he gestured toward
the stack of chairs that had blocked the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;The beavers couldn&rsquo;t
get in the other room with the door closed, could
they? I mean unless they gnawed their way in. That
must be where this old furniture is taken to be sanded
and varnished and made to look like new. We&rsquo;ll have
our whole table, just the way it was before the flood,
as soon as we find the other table leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the one the beavers stole?&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s
father asked, beginning to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;Your house wasn&rsquo;t broken
into except by beavers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; Peter pointed out, &ldquo;that whoever entered
this house had a key. Danny saw him using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was the only one with a key,&rdquo; George Anderson
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think! Didn&rsquo;t you give a key to someone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to the carpenter who boarded up the windows,
and he sent it right back as soon as the work
was finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have had time to order a duplicate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Judy broke in excitedly. &ldquo;Was the carpenter&rsquo;s
name John Beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately Judy regretted having asked the
question. It was like poking at a hornet&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Beer is an honest carpenter,&rdquo; Danny&rsquo;s father
exclaimed. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing like that. Get out,
both of you, before you make any more accusations.
I&rsquo;ll call the police myself and have this stolen stuff
hauled out of here, and then I&rsquo;ll get my boy back from
those meddling old ladies, and furthermore,&rdquo; he
added, glaring at Judy, &ldquo;if I find that cat of yours
prowling around in my house I&rsquo;ll wring its neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be so cruel! Come on, Peter,&rdquo; Judy
urged. When they were outside, she added, &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned John Beer. It was just a
guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty good one,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;He probably
did have refinished furniture in his truck and then,
when Sammis refused to buy it, he took it somewhere
else and sold it. If that&rsquo;s John Beer in the picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;The man
with the lady&rsquo;s face is tall and thin like&mdash;like Danny&rsquo;s
father. You don&rsquo;t think he will find Blackberry, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before we do&mdash;I hope. Even if he does, I
doubt that he&rsquo;ll carry out his threat. He&rsquo;s angry and
confused now, but when he has time to think this over
he may come to the same conclusion we did. That key
he gave John Beer may turn out to be the key to the
whole puzzle. Better call Blackberry once more before
we leave,&rdquo; Peter advised when they had reached
the car. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait long, though. I have a report
to turn in. George Anderson may not know it, but his
life may be in danger if we don&rsquo;t get some of our men
there fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the thieves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Peter agreed before Judy could
finish the alarming thought. &ldquo;If they return and find
him there they&rsquo;ll do anything to save their illegal business.
It wasn&rsquo;t his. I&rsquo;m convinced of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy began calling Blackberry. She walked a little
way along the woods road calling and searching. The
sun was low in the western sky. It looked like a bright
ball of fire as she glimpsed it through the trees. Soon
it would be dark.</p>
<p>With a shiver of apprehension she turned back. She
had called and called, but it was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve almost lost him so many times. Now I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;ve really lost him,&rdquo; she lamented as Peter
started the car and they drove off without Blackberry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>When they reached the first telephone Peter called
in his report and learned that George Anderson had
summoned the police just as he had threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t carry out his other threat, though.&rdquo;
Peter seemed convinced of this. Judy wished she could
be as sure of Blackberry&rsquo;s safety as he was.</p>
<p>As they passed the burned orphanage, they saw a
few people still standing about. The ruins of the building
still smoked, and one fire engine had not gone
back to its firehouse. But there were no orphans to
be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where they are. We were going to take
some of them home with us,&rdquo; Judy reminded Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will if any more homes are needed. I&rsquo;ll let you
off here. You can find out from your father. That
looks like his car parked in the next driveway,&rdquo; Peter
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;Dad must be inside that
neighbor&rsquo;s house with Meta Hanley. Oh, I hope she&rsquo;s
all right. I&rsquo;ll stay and see if I can do anything to help.
I know you&rsquo;ll be busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I!&rdquo; Peter agreed as a police car screamed to a
stop beside him and one of the officers took Judy&rsquo;s
place. Peter gave her a quick kiss and promised not
to forget Blackberry. Then he turned to the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men are fast,&rdquo; Judy heard him say as he sped
off, following the police car back to the house with
the boarded-up windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />Promised</h2>
<p>In the neighbor&rsquo;s house Judy did find her father.
Only his eyes showed surprise at seeing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Meta?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper. &ldquo;You did
come to see her, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sleeping. She&rsquo;ll be all right when
she wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the orphans? Are any of them here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door to an adjoining room. Four
babies, all under two years old, romped on a quilt
spread on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make a hard bed, but it was the best we
could do unless you want to take them home. There&rsquo;s
an older child helping Mrs. Alberts in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll take them&mdash;all five of them,&rdquo; declared
Judy in her impulsive way. &ldquo;Holly will help
me take care of them. Her sister&rsquo;s baby has outgrown
his crib, and I can put two more in the old trundle
bed stored in the attic, and two in the big spare bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute,&rdquo; Dr. Bolton stopped her.
&ldquo;Your mother and I have room for a baby or two in
our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be enough babies to go
around!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>On her way home in her father&rsquo;s car Judy had her
hands full. She was so busy with the babies that there
was no time to wonder what had become of Blackberry.
Two of her small charges slept, and two of
them cried. The older child wouldn&rsquo;t talk. She just
sat in a far corner of the car holding her baby brother
and looking frightened. She wouldn&rsquo;t even tell Judy
her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot it,&rdquo; she confessed at last. &ldquo;You can just
call me Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go inside and prepare your mother for a
shock,&rdquo; Dr. Bolton said when they reached Farringdon.
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t expecting company for dinner. You&rsquo;ll
help her with the babies, won&rsquo;t you, Judy girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help too,&rdquo; Sister spoke up. She wanted to give
her baby brother his bottle and explained his formula
very carefully to Judy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bolton made the children welcome, as Judy
had known she would, and Horace was there eager to
hear more about the orphanage fire. Now Judy could
give him the latest news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two boys started it by accident. Peter questioned
them, but he won&rsquo;t want his name mentioned. Neither
will I. You see,&rdquo; Judy explained, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re working on
something else. I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think we&rsquo;ve found
Holly&rsquo;s typewriter in that house with the boarded-up
windows. And you&rsquo;ll never guess what else was
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it? How did you get in? Is that where
the beavers got all that stuff they used to build their
dam? You didn&rsquo;t find any more of those lady table
legs, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace was asking questions too fast for Judy to
answer, but she did her best. When she told him they&rsquo;d
found the whole lady table refinished and looking like
new, he was really surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one leg is missing. It must be the one that
was in the beaver dam. I&rsquo;m sorry now that you didn&rsquo;t
take it,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;It must have been stolen
right after you and I left to take Danny back to the
orphanage. It was his father who let us into the house.
He said the orphans could stay there, but that was
before he saw all that loot from the Roulsville flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his own house. He must have known the
stuff was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Horace, I don&rsquo;t think he did. Danny knew it,
though. He watched the beavers drag some of that
stolen furniture out of the house and build it into
their dam. Then, when he saw a man open the door
with a key, it was easy for him to believe his father
might be the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds logical,&rdquo; Horace commented when
Judy stopped to spoon cereal into the mouth of one
of the babies. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, six years ago, Mr. Anderson gave a key to
the carpenter he hired to board up the windows. I
guessed the carpenter&rsquo;s name was John Beer. You
know he was doing business with Sammis, or trying
to. It all hangs together, but Danny&rsquo;s father can&rsquo;t
see it. He chased us out and called the police the
minute I mentioned John Beer&rsquo;s name. Peter went
back there with them, and that&rsquo;s all I can tell you until
I see him,&rdquo; Judy finished.</p>
<p>All the time she had been talking she had been busy
feeding the baby. Its mouth opened and closed as if it
were a hungry baby robin. Sister fed her own baby
brother, holding the bottle so carefully that he drank
every drop. The other two babies already were
sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that picture you took?&rdquo; Horace questioned
when they finally sat down to a late dinner.
&ldquo;You told me over the telephone that I&rsquo;d have to see
it to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is,&rdquo; Judy said, handing him the print.
&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s having the film blown up and separated&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy cow!&rdquo; Horace interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the
picture, but I still don&rsquo;t believe it. The beaver dam
shows right through this man&rsquo;s body. Or is it a man?
He has a lady&rsquo;s face. Did our lady table leg come to
life and decapitate him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have,&rdquo; Judy giggled. &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t come to life, and it didn&rsquo;t walk away,
either. We&rsquo;ll find it when we find the man in the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could write up a whale of a story with a mystery
angle,&rdquo; Horace began, but Judy stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait, and you&rsquo;ll have your story. We&rsquo;re not
sure of anything, but there may be something released
for publication when Peter gets home. It may
be late but I want to be there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all these babies?&rdquo; Horace questioned.</p>
<p>Two of them had slept right through dinner. These
were the two that had been crying in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were just tired, poor dears,&rdquo; Mrs. Bolton
sympathized. &ldquo;I have milk and cereal ready for them
when they wake up. Just leave them here, Judy girl.
You&rsquo;ll have enough to do, taking care of the other
three children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take care of Little Brother,&rdquo; Sister spoke up.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take him away from me, will they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy promised. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
both going to stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace offered to take them in his car. He wanted
to stop and ask Honey to go along for the ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a help with the babies,&rdquo; he began, but
Judy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well know it, Horace,&rdquo; she told him,
&ldquo;Holly is jealous of you and Honey. She has a crush
on you herself. If Honey is with us, Holly may not
want to lend me Bobby&rsquo;s outgrown crib, and this
baby I&rsquo;m holding is so lively she&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Horace was teasing again as they
started off. &ldquo;Suppose Holly isn&rsquo;t in the mood for
baby-sitting? You&rsquo;ll really be in a jam then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy couldn&rsquo;t see her brother&rsquo;s face from the back
seat of his car where she was minding the three children.
But she knew he must be smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take all three of them to my house,&rdquo; she decided,
ignoring his teasing. &ldquo;Then you can drive over
and borrow the crib and see if Holly is free to come
and help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed Horace as he turned in the long
driveway that led to the house Judy had inherited
from her grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This used to be a farm,&rdquo; Judy explained to Sister
as the little girl gazed about her in wide-eyed wonder.
&ldquo;I still have a horse and a cow and a few chickens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pussycat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pussycat,&rdquo; Judy agreed quickly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t
here right now. He&rsquo;s probably off hunting somewhere
in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />Identified</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Blackberry?&rdquo; Judy asked, the moment
Peter came home.</p>
<p>She had been nodding in the big chair, waiting up
for him. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find him, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I did make peace with
George Anderson so he won&rsquo;t hurt Blackberry if he
finds him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; Judy said. She yawned and
stretched. &ldquo;Those babies made a wreck out of me,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;I thought they&rsquo;d never go to sleep. And
they aren&rsquo;t the only ones! There are two more babies
with Mother. Let&rsquo;s go sit in the kitchen, and we can
talk over coffee.&rdquo; Peter was always hungry so Judy
cut him a piece of pie to go with the coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving
a piece for Horace,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here early
in the morning. Too early, probably,&rdquo; she added with
a yawn. &ldquo;He wants to print that ghost picture in the
paper before the man is identified, and make a mystery
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i06.jpg" alt="Judy stared at first one and then the other." width="500" height="755" />
<p class="caption"><i>Judy stared at first one and then the other.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too late. The mystery is solved,&rdquo; announced
Peter. &ldquo;I have the separations with me. You won&rsquo;t
know the man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed, seizing the pictures
and staring at first one and then the other. The lady
table leg was in the water just the way she had first
seen it. The picture was almost too clear. It made her
shiver just to look at it. The man&rsquo;s face, in the other
print, was equally clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know this man?&rdquo; Peter inquired in a puzzled
voice. &ldquo;Where on earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t really know him,&rdquo; Judy interrupted.
&ldquo;His picture is in the Post Office, isn&rsquo;t it? Horace and
I were looking at it the other day, and I remember
saying he didn&rsquo;t look like a criminal. I&rsquo;m so glad you
found him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t found, just identified,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
one of Joe Mott&rsquo;s boys, of course. They&rsquo;ve robbed
everything from banks to flooded towns and set up
all sorts of fronts for their illegal business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fronts?&rdquo; Judy questioned. &ldquo;Do you mean places
like that sheared-off house? That hadn&rsquo;t any front.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;I see what you mean, but it was a
front just the same. Sammis will talk. He knew what
was going on and wanted to frighten you away before
you found out, but I&rsquo;m afraid he overdid it. Actually
that sheared-off house is still owned by Mr.
Truitt. It&rsquo;s one of a chain of second-hand stores. Our
agent, Hank Lawson, found out that much from
Donna Truitt herself. They had a good time on their
date this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy wasn&rsquo;t sure just what Peter meant. She had
been too busy with the babies to think much about
what was happening anywhere else. And now she
was too tired to care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be tired, too,&rdquo; she told him as she
cleared away the coffee cups. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long day.
That orphanage fire alone was enough to make Meta
Hanley collapse from exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what did it. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
asked Peter. &ldquo;It was when she realized it was all a
mistake and George Anderson still loved her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or was it when she thought he was a thief? I&rsquo;m
glad he isn&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t blame him for being angry.
You said you made peace with him. I&rsquo;m glad of that,
too,&rdquo; Judy said with another yawn. &ldquo;You can tell me
all about the real thieves in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Horace here? Not on your life,&rdquo; declared
Peter. &ldquo;This is confidential. I wouldn&rsquo;t have told you
as much as I did if you hadn&rsquo;t helped me uncover the
man&rsquo;s identity. We&rsquo;re hoping he returns to the shop he
set up in George Anderson&rsquo;s house where our men
will be waiting to nab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say he set up the shop?&rdquo; asked Judy, still puzzled.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t John Beer have anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it looks as if he was only an employee of
the Joe Mott syndicate. We&rsquo;ll pick him up for questioning
when he comes to work tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peter, that&rsquo;s what you said about Aldin
Launt, and you never picked him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; he predicted. &ldquo;We were hoping he
would help us trap the others, but now that house
with the boarded-up windows is all the trap we
need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean we can&rsquo;t go back there and look
for Blackberry? Oh dear! I couldn&rsquo;t go anyway with
all these babies in the house,&rdquo; Judy remembered. And
suddenly, partly because she was overtired and partly
because she felt she hadn&rsquo;t been much of a help after
all, she began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Angel, Blackberry will turn up.&rdquo;
Peter was trying to comfort her and only making
matters worse with his sympathy.</p>
<p>Blackberry wasn&rsquo;t the only reason for her tears,
Judy insisted. And yet, somehow, her cat&rsquo;s latest disappearance
and the responsibility of three children all
at once made her feel as if the sky had fallen on her
shoulders.</p>
<p>Twice, during what was left of the night, the babies
cried and Judy had to get up and attend to their needs.
She was sound asleep, and the whole house was quiet
and peaceful, when Holly arrived in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; she announced, ringing the doorbell and
shattering the quiet. Still half asleep, Judy put on a
housecoat and went downstairs to let her in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth says you found my typewriter. I&rsquo;m so grateful
to you, Judy!&rdquo; Holly exclaimed as she bounced
into the living room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to baby sit for those
orphans when you drive over to get it. I may as well
get in practice. Some day I intend to get married and
raise a whole houseful of children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do? That&rsquo;s a switch,&rdquo; declared Judy, blinking
in the sudden sunshine that streamed through the open
door. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to you? I thought you were
going to be a grief-stricken old maid without even a
cat for company. You said it was unlucky to love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that was before I met Roger! We had a
fabulous time last night,&rdquo; Holly declared. &ldquo;I hardly
knew the girl who gave the party. Ruth made me go,
and am I ever thankful! Lois was there with some boy
I&rsquo;ve never seen before, and Donna Truitt had this
handsome stranger off in a corner. They talked and
talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard.&rdquo; Judy didn&rsquo;t say the stranger was an
FBI agent. She just listened as Holly went on and on
about Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His family just moved here, and he&rsquo;s going to high
school in Roulsville. I can&rsquo;t wait for school to begin. I
told him all about the library exhibit, and he wants
to see it. Naturally, I have to go with him to explain
everything. Oh, by the way, you won&rsquo;t forget to stop
for those old Christmas cards the Jewell sisters
promised us, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Jewell sisters!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
I think of it before? Maybe Blackberry went over to
call on the Jewell sisters! Violetta is fond of him.
We&rsquo;ll drive over and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped there. The doorbell was ringing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answer it,&rdquo; Judy told Holly, almost pushing
her toward the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still in my housecoat. If
it&rsquo;s Horace, tell him I&rsquo;ll be ready in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />Discovered</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is it morning already?&rdquo; Peter called drowsily
from upstairs. &ldquo;I thought I heard the doorbell. Who
are all those people talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those people,&rdquo; Judy said, laughing, as she ran
up the stairs, &ldquo;are Horace and Honey. They just came.
Holly is here, too. She&rsquo;s going to baby sit for me so
Horace can drive me over to the Jewell sisters&rsquo; place.
Blackberry may be there. I just thought, if I were a
cat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call really putting yourself in somebody
else&rsquo;s place.&rdquo; Peter laughed. &ldquo;Blackberry is as
good as found. You&rsquo;ll see Danny, of course. You might
tell him his father is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Judy said eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have time for breakfast,&rdquo; Peter continued.
&ldquo;I may grab a bite with Hank Lawson later. We&rsquo;re due
at the Anderson house in less than an hour. We&rsquo;ll be
there all day if you need us. George Anderson may
be visiting his son later on. I&rsquo;m depending on you to
prepare Danny for the visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prepare him. How much can I tell Horace?&rdquo;
asked Judy. She was afraid she had already told her
brother too much, but Peter didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need his help when all this stolen stuff is
hauled to the police station or wherever we decide to
hold it until the owners come to claim it. We&rsquo;re only
waiting to nab Earle Haley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; Judy interrupted to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in the ghost picture. You photographed
the unknown gang leader who took Joe
Mott&rsquo;s place. We think Earle Haley is his real name.
He may be Arnold Earle. Whatever he calls himself,
he&rsquo;s known to the Joe Mott syndicate as the Earl, and
I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t be an easy man to catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have the trap all set for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You see, Judy, why it&rsquo;s so important
that you don&rsquo;t come near that house with the
boarded-up windows. We&rsquo;ll take the boards down as
soon as it&rsquo;s safe. Tell Horace not to take the woods
road when he drives you over to the Jewell place. Go
the old way. Horace can leave his car across the creek.
Is Honey going with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked her, but it is Saturday. She isn&rsquo;t
working so I guess she could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that make your friend downstairs a little
jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly? Oh, Peter! She&rsquo;s met a high school boy
named Roger, and she&rsquo;s crazy about him. She&rsquo;s acting
like herself for the first time since her uncle died. She&rsquo;s
no longer brooding over the way her sister treats her.
It was Ruth who suggested the party. I almost wish
I&rsquo;d been there myself,&rdquo; Judy finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donna wouldn&rsquo;t have talked if you&rsquo;d been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I was too tired to enjoy a party, anyway.
When this is all over we&rsquo;ll have one of our own. I
think I&rsquo;ll invite Donna,&rdquo; Judy decided. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to
need friends. Poor girl! I wouldn&rsquo;t be in her place for a
million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;I guess her father made a million.
But I wouldn&rsquo;t be in his place, either. We&rsquo;re picking
him up with all the rest of Joe Mott&rsquo;s boys. It&rsquo;s going
to be a busy day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy felt rested and ready for it. When she went
downstairs again Holly was telling Honey all about
Roger, and Horace was standing there, ignored by
both of them and obviously enjoying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Honey,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;can you tear yourself
away, or don&rsquo;t you want to go calling on the
Jewell sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today. I think I&rsquo;ll stay here and help Holly
with the babies. I hear one of them crying now!&rdquo; And
Honey flew upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will wonders never cease! Well, come on, Sis,&rdquo;
Horace said to Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; Judy declared. She gave Peter a quick
kiss, and he was off. Hank Lawson had just driven up
in the official car. Horace followed in his coffee-colored
convertible with Judy beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about breakfast?&rdquo; he asked as they passed
through Farringdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace said he had eaten a bite at home. &ldquo;Mother
was too busy with the babies to fix much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; Judy told him. &ldquo;The Jewell sisters
will spread out a feast for us the moment we enter
the house. I know them. We&rsquo;ll probably have home-made
biscuits or doughnuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right. She and Horace were invited to the
table minutes after they arrived. Danny and his friends
were already eating and apparently enjoying their
breakfast. They had emptied the heaping platter of
scrambled eggs, but there was corn bread and fresh
apple sauce.</p>
<p>And there was Blackberry under the table eating
the crumbs as the children let them fall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I scramble some more eggs for you? The
hens are laying plenty,&rdquo; Violetta began.</p>
<p>But the corn bread, fresh from the oven, looked so
good that Judy told her not to bother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
you found Blackberry,&rdquo; she added, picking up her cat
and hugging him. &ldquo;I guess he didn&rsquo;t even know he
was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;He came up to the door and yowled to come in
just like the gentleman he is,&rdquo; Dorcas informed her.
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d sent him to us when you took those
babies home. Meta called up and told us. She&rsquo;s coming
over this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she was afraid she&rsquo;d been a little hard on
Danny&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; Violetta added. &ldquo;It seems it was all a
mistake. I&rsquo;ll be glad to see her. She hasn&rsquo;t been here
since that thief borrowed her car. It wasn&rsquo;t Danny&rsquo;s
father. The poor boy was so upset thinking it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know it wasn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re not sure who it
was,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re certain who it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>.
Danny, your poor father was as surprised as we were
to find your house full of stolen furniture. Here&rsquo;s a
picture of the man you were following. His name is
Earle Haley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Earl? Gosh, he&rsquo;s dangerous!&rdquo; one of the other
boys interrupted, looking at Danny with admiration.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never dare follow him. He&rsquo;s wanted by the FBI.
His picture&rsquo;s in the Post Office&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is? Maybe he was the one who stole Ma&rsquo;s car
and then brought it back,&rdquo; Danny suggested.</p>
<p>Horace shook his head. &ldquo;It was a boy about sixteen.
I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did Holly. He stole her typewriter. She wants
me to bring it back,&rdquo; Judy remembered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid I can&rsquo;t do it yet. Peter wants everybody to stay
away from your house, Danny, until the boards are off
the windows. He&rsquo;s hoping the thieves will be trapped
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;With my father in the house? They can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;
Danny cried, jumping up from the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
over there this minute and tell him I&rsquo;m sorry for the
way I treated him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Danny, you can&rsquo;t go over there until the
boards are off the windows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy found herself talking to the air. Danny was
already gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys stay here and don&rsquo;t let Judy&rsquo;s cat out.
We&rsquo;ll be back for him,&rdquo; Horace called over his shoulder
as he started after Danny. Judy was already running
along the woods road, a half-eaten piece of corn
bread in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go there, Danny! Please don&rsquo;t go there!&rdquo;
she called. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get your father into more
trouble. Wait and he&rsquo;ll come for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; Danny called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right where I
always am&mdash;at the beaver dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there, too, won&rsquo;t we, Horace?&rdquo; asked
Judy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out what this is all about or die trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may die all right,&rdquo; agreed her brother. &ldquo;It was
never as safe as we thought it was with the Earl and
his boys hanging around. He&rsquo;s armed and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is Peter,&rdquo; Judy said, glad for once of the gun
she had often wished he didn&rsquo;t have to carry. He
wouldn&rsquo;t use it, she knew, unless the criminals made
it necessary. Was that one of them now, in the woods
just ahead?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Danny stopped short. He had seen a boy running
toward them at the same time Judy called Horace&rsquo;s
attention to him with a quick, terrified gesture. All
three of them stood frozen. The boy was wearing a
striped T-shirt, and in his hand was something that
looked amazingly like the missing leg from the lady
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; Judy whispered, seeing the quiet face turn
toward her almost as if it were alive. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t long to wonder. They had reached the
beaver dam. There were the familiar ripples that told
Judy the beavers were on the way to their dome-shaped
lodge of brush and sticks. The entrance, for
safety&rsquo;s sake, was under water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; Horace whispered, his hand in front of
Judy to hold her back.</p>
<p>The boy stood near the beaver lodge for a moment
as if undecided. Then he raised the table leg and
hurled it into the pond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />An Everlasting Thing</h2>
<p>There was no holding Judy back after that. She
seized the boy by the tail of his T-shirt while Danny
turned on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you, Buck Lester,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You
ran away from the orphanage two years ago. What&rsquo;d
you come back for and where&rsquo;d you find that lady
stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy seemed frightened by the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you, Danny?&rdquo; he asked, not looking at
Judy or Horace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job, and I have to do what
my boss tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did your boss tell you to throw that thing in the
water?&rdquo; Judy asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a valuable table leg. Don&rsquo;t
you know the whole table&rsquo;s over there in that house?&rdquo;
Judy waved her hand toward the house with the
boarded-up windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my house. My father&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; Danny began,
but a voice stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, son, I&rsquo;m right here,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, coming
through the trees. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take you home until
the police have hauled all that stolen stuff back to
Roulsville where the owners can claim it. But we can
go and see Ma, as you call her in your letters. How
would you like it if she became your real mother and
we were a family again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny hesitated a moment. Then he said, without
emotion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other then, and the years they
had been separated seemed to evaporate like the morning
mist over the pond. With his arm around his son,
George Anderson turned to Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I owe you an apology,&rdquo; he began, but she
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Anderson. I owe you one. I should have
known those thieves had taken over your house without
your permission. Did they come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly did. I was warned to keep out of
the way, but there wasn&rsquo;t any shooting. Your husband
and the other FBI agent got there just in time to relieve
the Earl, as he calls himself, of his gun. Without
it he was nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my boss,&rdquo; the runaway boy spoke up defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was</i>,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be any more. Why
don&rsquo;t you give me the whole story? How did you get
mixed up in this racket? You&rsquo;re the boy who took
that green car the other day and came back with a
typewriter, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, the boss wanted one in a hurry. He had some
letters to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he told you to go out and steal one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that was my job. If he told me to get anything
I went out and got it. I didn&rsquo;t ask questions.
He&rsquo;d cased that house and spotted some other stuff he
wanted, too, but I didn&rsquo;t have time to pick it up. The
boss understood. He ain&rsquo;t a bad guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, you have a lot to learn,&rdquo; Horace commented,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>It was Danny who retrieved the lady stick, as he
called it. He went into the pond after it before anyone
could stop him and came out dripping wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, it isn&rsquo;t hurt much,&rdquo; he announced, presenting
it to Judy. &ldquo;The lady&rsquo;s got a couple of tooth marks in
her cheek, and the end where the leg screws into the
table is chewed a little, but we can fix that, can&rsquo;t we,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much good at fixing damaged furniture,&rdquo;
his father confessed. &ldquo;The business I had in mind was
raising chickens. As soon as we get you dried out we&rsquo;ll
start making plans. How about it, son? Would you
like to go into partnership with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask Ma,&rdquo; Danny protested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
and find her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be hard to find. The Jewell sisters are
expecting her for tea. I think raising chickens is a
wonderful idea,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;Oh! Here comes
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had seen Judy from the house where the
boards had already been removed from one window.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to come in now,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad
you weren&rsquo;t here an hour ago when the Earl drove up.
He saw us and started to run, but we nabbed him and
disarmed him. Meantime the boy in the car with him
ran off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not very far,&rdquo; Horace interrupted, emerging
from the woods with Buck Lester in tow. &ldquo;We caught
him throwing this in the beaver pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter stared at the object they were carrying between
them as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. Then he
turned to the boy. &ldquo;The FBI can use all the information
you can give us,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too late, G-man. I already gave it to this
newspaper guy,&rdquo; Buck informed him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
put my picture in the paper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there,&rdquo; Horace stopped him. &ldquo;When
you grow up a bit you won&rsquo;t want that kind of publicity.
How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;not that it&rsquo;s any of your
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter looked him over appraisingly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.
I think we can still make something of this boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Danny and his father walked on ahead, going home
at last. The others came more slowly, taking turns
carrying the lady table leg. It was badly in need of refinishing
and yet, somehow, when it was placed beside
the other three table legs, Judy liked it best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll leave that tooth mark in the lady&rsquo;s
face,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;It gives her more character. The
other three faces are too quiet and patient, but this one
looks as if she&rsquo;d <i>lived</i>. Do you think Dad will mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; exclaimed Horace. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before another week had passed, a great many
pieces that belonged to Dr. Bolton were found.
Among them was his fruitwood bench, but that was
located in one of the exclusive shops in Mr. Truitt&rsquo;s
chain. The shop was over the state line in Wellsville.</p>
<p>Donna Truitt and Hank Lawson, the FBI agent she
had dated, were both invited to Judy&rsquo;s party. The
house was still filled with babies as Judy and Peter had
agreed to keep them until Mr. and Mrs. George Anderson
returned from their honeymoon.</p>
<p>It would be a strange honeymoon, the crowd at the
party agreed, as they had taken Danny with them on a
cruise to some romantic island and would return to
turn their house into another orphans&rsquo; home, complete
with chicken farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny will find plenty of wild things to watch,
but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll see any beavers on a tropical
island,&rdquo; Peter commented as he handed around Judy&rsquo;s
beaver pictures. Some of them had appeared in the
<i>Farringdon Daily Herald</i> to illustrate Horace&rsquo;s news
stories. The picture of the man with the lady&rsquo;s face
had caused a real sensation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mistakes you make are better than the things
some people do on purpose,&rdquo; declared Holly, whose
interest in writing had waned only to flare up again
when her typewriter was returned. Now she was
writing notes to Roger and tearing them up before he
saw them.</p>
<p>Judy met Roger for the first time that evening. She
could see why Holly was attracted to him. He had
brought his banjo to the party and knew all the song
hits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, everybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sing along with
Roger. Have you got the beat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy thought of the honeymooners, then back to
her own wedding day as they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s not a sudden romance</p>
<p class="t0">Or the kiss that follows a dance.</p>
<p class="t0">Love is forever, an everlasting thing.</p>
<p class="t0">Love is a golden ring.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>After the first chorus, the song went on and on,
verse after verse. But Judy was no longer thinking
back. She was thinking ahead to her next mystery,
although she had not yet found THE HIDDEN
CLUE among the few things that had been saved
from the orphanage fire. Tonight she was glad to
forget the fire and enjoy her party, but something
was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t set enough places,&rdquo; she observed as her
friends gathered around the party table. &ldquo;There are
five places for Donna and Lois and the others on that
side. Horace and Honey are to sit here, Holly and
Roger here, but where is my place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right beside mine,&rdquo; declared Peter, coming up behind
her with an extra place setting. &ldquo;Move over,
everybody! Judy was so busy setting places for
everyone else that she forgot her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another little mistake,&rdquo; Judy explained cheerfully
as she began to cut the cake.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
